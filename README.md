## Contributing

**We heartily welcome any and all contributions that match our engineering standards!**

That being said, this codebase isn't your typical open source project because it's not a library or package with a limited scope -- it's our entire product.

### Ground Rules

#### Contributions and discussion guidelines

By making a contribution to this project, you are deemed to have accepted the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO).

All conversations and communities on Medplum agree to GitHub's [Community Guidelines](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines) and [Acceptable Use Policies](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies). This code of conduct also applies to all conversations that happen within our contributor community here on GitHub. We expect discussions in issues and pull requests to stay positive, productive, and respectful. Remember: there are real people on the other side of that screen!

#### Reporting a bug or discussing a feature idea

If you found a technical bug on Medplum or have ideas for features we should implement, the issue tracker is the best place to share your ideas. Make sure to follow the issue template and you should be golden! ([click here to open a new issue](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/issues/new))

#### Fixing a bug or implementing a new feature

If you find a bug on Medplum and open a PR that fixes it we'll review it as soon as possible to ensure it matches our engineering standards.

If you want to implement a new feature, open an issue first to discuss what it'd look like and to ensure it fits in our roadmap and plans for the app.

If you want to contribute but are unsure to start, we have [a "good first issue" label](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) which is applied to newcomer-friendly issues. Take a look at [the full list of good first issues](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) and pick something you like!

Want to fix a bug or implement an agreed-upon feature? Great, jump to the [local setup instructions](#first-time-setup)!

### Codebase

#### Technologies

With the ground rules out of the way, let's talk about the coarse architecture of this mono repo:

- **Full-stack TypeScript**: We use Node.js to power our servers, and React to power our frontend apps. Almost all of the code you'll touch in this codebase will be TypeScript.

Here is a list of all the big technologies we use:

- **PostgreSQL**: Data storage
- **Redis**: Background jobs and caching
- **Express**: API server
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **React**: Frontend React app
