## Contributing

**We heartily welcome any and all contributions that match our engineering standards!**

That being said, this codebase isn't your typical open-source project because it's not a library or package with a
limited scope -- it's our entire product. Our [Contributing documentation](https://medplum.com/docs/contributing) has
all the information you need to get started.

### Ground Rules

#### Contributions and discussion guidelines

By making a contribution to this project, you are deemed to have accepted the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO).

All conversations and communities on Medplum are expected to follow GitHub's [Community Guidelines](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines)
and [Acceptable Use Policies](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies). We expect
discussions on issues and pull requests to stay positive, productive, and respectful. Remember: there are real people on
the other side of the screen!

#### Reporting a bug or proposing a new feature

If you found a technical bug on Medplum or have ideas for features we should implement, the issue tracker is the best
place to share with us. ([click here to open a new issue](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/issues/new))

### Writing documentation or blog content

Did you learn how to do something using Medplum that wasn't obvious on your first try? By contributing your new knowledge
to our documentation, you can help others who might have a similar use case!

Our documentation is hosted on [medplum.com/docs](/docs), but it is built from [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
files in our [`docs` package](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/tree/main/packages/docs/docs).

For relatively small changes, you can edit files directly from your web browser on [Github.dev](https://github.dev/medplum/medplum/blob/main/packages/docs/docs/home.md)
without needing to clone the repository.

#### Fixing a bug or implementing a new feature

If you find a bug and open a Pull Request that fixes it, we'll review it as soon as possible to ensure it meets our engineering standards.

If you want to implement a new feature, open an issue first to discuss with us how the feature might work, and to ensure
it fits into our roadmap and plans for the app.

If you want to contribute but are unsure how to start, we have [a "good first issue" label](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) which is applied to newcomer-friendly issues. Take a look at [the full list of good first issues](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) and pick something you like!

### Codebase

#### Technologies

With the ground rules out of the way, let's talk about the coarse architecture of this mono repo:

- **Full-stack TypeScript**: We use Node.js to power our servers, and React to power our frontend apps. Almost all of the code you'll touch in this codebase will be TypeScript.

Here is a list of all the big technologies we use:

- **PostgreSQL**: Data storage
- **Redis**: Background jobs and caching
- **Express**: API server
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **React**: Frontend React app
