/**
 * A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient.   A
 * MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the
 * medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be
 * taking the medication in the future.  The source of this information
 * can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or
 * spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario where this information is
 * captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit
 * or stay.   The medication information may come from sources such as
 * the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle,  or from a list of
 * medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.
 *
 * The primary difference between a medication statement and a medication
 * administration is that the medication administration has complete
 * administration information and is based on actual administration
 * information from the person who administered the medication.  A
 * medication statement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is
 * no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we
 * only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this
 * medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even
 * medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise.  As
 * stated earlier, the medication statement information may come from the
 * patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of
 * medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.
 * Medication administration is more formal and is not missing detailed
 * information.
