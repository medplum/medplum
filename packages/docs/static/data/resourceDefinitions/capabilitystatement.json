A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).",
