Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the Medplum Service.

These Terms include Medplum's Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into these Terms. We have included several annotations in boxes to help explain the legal jargon and emphasize key sections. These annotations are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

"You" and "users" shall mean all health service providers and their agents who use the Medplum Service. You accept these Terms by signing up for the Medplum Service, when you agree to them using our website at https://www.medplum.com/, and each time you access the Medplum Service thereafter. If you do not accept these Terms, you must not use the Medplum Service. Revisions to Terms. We may revise these Terms at any time by posting an updated version to this web page.

Compulsory Information Disclosure. You will promptly notify us of any order or demand for compulsory disclosure of health-related information if the disclosure requires access to or use of the Medplum Service. You will cooperate fully with us in connection with any such demand.

## Medplum's Health-Related Information Practices

Medplum voluntarily complies with the requirements of the "Privacy Rule" and "Security Rule" as defined by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") of 1996 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH Act"). We may use and disclose health-related information to provide our services. We may use de-identified health-related information as permitted by law. Use and Disclosure. We may use and process the health-related information posted to the Medplum Service for the proper management, provision, and administration of the Medplum Service and our business, and as required by law. We may also disclose health-related information if required by law or we obtain reasonable assurances from the recipient that such information will be held confidentially and used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purpose for which we disclosed it. You agree that Medplum may use and share de- identified health-related information to the fullest extent permitted by law. Data Transfers at Your Request. We do not transfer health-related information to third parties, other than our vendors, suppliers and as required to process patient billing. We may transfer health-related information to third parties, including health plans, health-care clearinghouse, and others. You authorize us to make such transfers upon the request of you and the users who are acting under your account. You acknowledge that when you consent to transferring the information to third parties, we have no control over how those third parties will use and disclose the information. We will use appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to prevent use or disclosure of health-related information other than as provided for by these Terms. Appropriate Safeguards. We will use appropriate safeguards to prevent the use or disclosure of health-related information other than as provided for by these Terms, including administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information. Security Incident. We will report to you any discovered use or disclosure of health- related information not provided for by these Terms, or when we determine that unauthorized access to health-related information has occurred. Our Agents. We will ensure that any of our agents, suppliers, and vendors to whom we provide health-related information for purposes of assisting us in providing the Medplum Service, agrees to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to us with respect to such information, including the obligation to implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards. Access, Amendment, and Accountings. We will facilitate your requirements under the Privacy Rule to give patients access and the ability to amend health-related information you posted to the Medplum Service. We may also facilitate an accounting of disclosures as required by the Privacy Rule. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") Audits. We will give HHS access to our internal practices, books, and records related to the use and disclosure of health- related information for the purposes of determining your compliance with the Privacy Rule. The Medplum Service retains the information you post to it for compliance and regulatory purposes and will cooperate with you regarding requests to delete information. We will provide you copies of health-related information in electronic form if you decide to terminate your use of the Medplum Service. Termination of these Terms. At the termination of these Terms we will provide you with a copy of health-related information in an electronic form that is accessible through commercially available hardware and software. If feasible, we will also return or destroy all health-related information you or your employees or patients post to the Medplum Service. If such return or destruction is not feasible, we will continue to abide by these Terms with respect to such information and limit further uses and disclosures to those purposes that make the return or destruction of the information infeasible. You acknowledge that segregating health-related information for removal from the Medplum Service may be infeasible. Security Rule. We will comply with the provisions of the HIPAA Security Rule that are made applicable to business associates. We will notify you of the discovery of any breach of health-related information that we store and we will cooperate reasonably with you to investigate and mitigate any such breach. We will provide you with the necessary information to make any legally required notification to individuals.

Compelled Disclosure.

If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information.

## Copyright Policy

Let us know if you think a user has violated your copyright using the Medplum Service, or if you think someone incorrectly reported that you violated his or her copyright. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials posted on the Medplum Service infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Medplum a "Notification of Claimed Infringement" requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information:

- A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;
- Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Medplum Service are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);
- Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Medplum to locate the material on the Medplum Service;
- Your name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available);
- A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
- A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
- If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Medplum a counter-notice.
- Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Medplum Service should be sent to support@medplum.com. Consult your legal advisor and see 17 U.S.C. Section 512 before filing a notice or counter-notice as there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.
