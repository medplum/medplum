# Terms of Service

## Introduction and Eligibility

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the Medplum Service.

These Terms include Medplum's Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into these Terms. We have included several annotations in boxes to help explain the legal jargon and emphasize key sections. These annotations are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. This agreement is a legally binding contract. It may change as our business changes, and you agree you will review it and any updates regularly.

## Binding Agreement

These Terms constitute a binding agreement between you and Medplum and its affiliates and subsidiaries ("Medplum," "we," "us"). "You" and "users" shall mean all health service providers and their agents who use the Medplum Service. You accept these Terms by signing up for the Medplum Service, when you agree to them using our website at https://www.medplum.com/, and each time you access the Medplum Service thereafter. If you do not accept these Terms, you must not use the Medplum Service. Revisions to Terms. We may revise these Terms at any time by posting an updated version to this web page. You should visit this page periodically to review the most current Terms, because you are bound by them. Your continued use of the Medplum Service after a change to these Terms constitutes your binding acceptance of these Terms. The terms "post" and "posting" as used in these Terms shall mean the act of submitting, uploading, publishing, displaying, or similar action on the Medplum Service. "Health-related information" means all individually identifiable health information, including demographic information and information related to an individual's physical or mental health, the provision of health care to the individual, or the individual's payment for the provision of health care. "Health service provider" means an entity that provides health-related services.

## The Medplum Service

The "Medplum Service" is defined as any computer or mobile application or software under Medplum's control, whether partial or otherwise, in connection with providing the services provided by Medplum. The Medplum Service provides a platform to store health- related information to make it available to you and your employees. Medical data is archived for 7 years from the time it is posted on Medplum.

Medical Advice. Medplum does not give medical advice. The Medplum Service may include certain third-party software and services. Your use of such software or services may require that you enter into separate subscription or licensing agreements with third-party vendors and suppliers. You agree to comply with and, upon request, execute such agreements as may be required for the use of such software or services.

## No Third-Party Access

Except as required by law and described below, you will not permit any third party to have access to the Medplum Service using your account. You may allow your employees to use the Medplum Service on your behalf in compliance with these Terms. You may also allow patients to make payment for your services through the Medplum Service in compliance with these Terms. You are solely responsible for the use of the Medplum Service by your employees and patients. We have no liability for the consequences to you or your employees or patients from your or their use of the Medplum Service.

## Responsibility for Misuse by Other Users

You acknowledge that by allowing employees and patients to access the Medplum Service with your account, you are responsible for ensuring such employees and patients use the Medplum Service for the purposes for which they are accessing it. While the Medplum Service has certain technical safeguards against misuse, you acknowledge it will rely to a substantial extent on your responsible use. You agree that we will not be responsible for any unlawful access to or use of the Medplum Service by any employee or patient to whom you gave access or log-in credentials. You agree that you are responsible for ensuring that health-related information is properly protected under applicable law. You represent and warrant that you received any necessary consents from individuals before posting their information in the Medplum Service.

## Individuals' Consent for Data Collection and Use

You represent and warrant that you have obtained the proper consents, authorizations, and releases from individuals to the fullest extent required by applicable law before posting their health-related information to the Medplum Service.

## Exporting Information from the Medplum Service

You are solely responsible for any health-related information exported from the Medplum Service by you or the employees and patients that you allow access from your account. Training and Compliance. You agree to train all employees on the use of the Medplum Service, HIPAA or health privacy obligations, and the requirements of these Terms and ensure that they comply with such requirements.

## Compulsory Information Disclosure

You will promptly notify us of any order or demand for compulsory disclosure of health-related information if the disclosure requires access to or use of the Medplum Service. You will cooperate fully with us in connection with any such demand.

## Medplum's Health-Related Information Practices

Medplum voluntarily complies with the requirements of the "Privacy Rule" and "Security Rule" as defined by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") of 1996 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH Act"). We may use and disclose health-related information to provide our services. We may use de-identified health-related information as permitted by law.

## Use and Disclosure

We may use and process the health-related information posted to the Medplum Service for the proper management, provision, and administration of the Medplum Service and our business, and as required by law. We may also disclose health-related information if required by law or we obtain reasonable assurances from the recipient that such information will be held confidentially and used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purpose for which we disclosed it. You agree that Medplum may use and share de-identified health-related information to the fullest extent permitted by law.

## Data Transfers at Your Request

We do not transfer health-related information to third parties, other than our vendors, suppliers and as required to process patient billing. We may transfer health-related information to third parties, including health plans, health-care clearinghouse, and others. You authorize us to make such transfers upon the request of you and the users who are acting under your account. You acknowledge that when you consent to transferring the information to third parties, we have no control over how those third parties will use and disclose the information. We will use appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to prevent use or disclosure of health-related information other than as provided for by these Terms.

## Appropriate Safeguards

We will use appropriate safeguards to prevent the use or disclosure of health-related information other than as provided for by these Terms, including administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information.

## Security Incident

We will report to you any discovered use or disclosure of health- related information not provided for by these Terms, or when we determine that unauthorized access to health-related information has occurred.

## Our Agents

We will ensure that any of our agents, suppliers, and vendors to whom we provide health-related information for purposes of assisting us in providing the Medplum Service, agrees to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to us with respect to such information, including the obligation to implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards.

## Access, Amendment, and Accountings

We will facilitate your requirements under the Privacy Rule to give patients access and the ability to amend health-related information you posted to the Medplum Service. We may also facilitate an accounting of disclosures as required by the Privacy Rule.

## Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") Audits

We will give HHS access to our internal practices, books, and records related to the use and disclosure of health- related information for the purposes of determining your compliance with the Privacy Rule. The Medplum Service retains the information you post to it for compliance and regulatory purposes and will cooperate with you regarding requests to delete information. We will provide you copies of health-related information in electronic form if you decide to terminate your use of the Medplum Service.

## Termination of these Terms

At the termination of these Terms we will provide you with a copy of health-related information in an electronic form that is accessible through commercially available hardware and software. If feasible, we will also return or destroy all health-related information you or your employees or patients post to the Medplum Service. If such return or destruction is not feasible, we will continue to abide by these Terms with respect to such information and limit further uses and disclosures to those purposes that make the return or destruction of the information infeasible. You acknowledge that segregating health-related information for removal from the Medplum Service may be infeasible.

## Security Rule

We will comply with the provisions of the HIPAA Security Rule that are made applicable to business associates. We will notify you of the discovery of any breach of health-related information that we store and we will cooperate reasonably with you to investigate and mitigate any such breach. We will provide you with the necessary information to make any legally required notification to individuals.

## Account Creation and Secure Credentials

## Confidential Information

"Confidential Information" means all confidential information disclosed by a party ("Disclosing Party") to the other party ("Receiving Party"), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Your Confidential Information shall include the data you post to the Medplum Service, not including health-related information; Medplum Confidential Information shall include the Medplum Service, customer feedback, and information relating to the performance, reliability, or stability of the Medplum Service, operation of the Medplum Service, know-how, techniques, processes, ideas, algorithms, and software design and architecture; and Confidential Information of each party shall include business and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business processes disclosed by such party.

## Compelled Disclosure

The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information.

It is very important that you have permission to use other people's content or they may be able to sue you for violating their legal rights.

## Medplum Claims No Ownership

The Medplum Service may provide you with the ability to create, post, or share content ("Your User Content"). Medplum claims no ownership over Your User Content.

## Copyright Policy

Let us know if you think a user has violated your copyright using the Medplum Service, or if you think someone incorrectly reported that you violated his or her copyright. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials posted on the Medplum Service infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Medplum a "Notification of Claimed Infringement" requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information:

- A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;
- Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Medplum Service are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);
- Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Medplum to locate the material on the Medplum Service;
- Your name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available);
- A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
- A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
- If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Medplum a counter-notice.
- Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Medplum Service should be sent to support@medplum.com. Consult your legal advisor and see 17 U.S.C. Section 512 before filing a notice or counter-notice as there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.
