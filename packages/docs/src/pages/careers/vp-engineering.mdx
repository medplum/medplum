- **Operational Involvement**: Be the engineering representative for planning, triage, and customer engagements. Take a hands-on approach to project management, actively involving yourself in both the detailed execution and overarching strategy of our engineering efforts.

We are looking for a leader who can not only shape the technical direction of our company but also inspire and grow our engineering team.
