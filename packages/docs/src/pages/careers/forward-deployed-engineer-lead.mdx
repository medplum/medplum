# Forward Deployed Engineering Lead

![Forward Deployed Engineer Lead](/img/careers/forward-deployed-engineer-lead.webp)

## About the Role

Medplum is the operating system for modern healthcare. Because our platform is highly flexible and deeply technical, our customers—ranging from seed-stage startups to massive health systems—require more than just "support." They require high-level technical partnership to build their core clinical infrastructure.

As the **Forward Deployed Engineering (FDE) Lead**, you will head the team that sits at the intersection of Engineering, Product, and Sales. You will be the "Technical Closer" for our most strategic accounts and the primary mentor for our FDE team. Your goal is to ensure "Production Success" for our customers by helping them architect, build, and ship their clinical applications on the Medplum stack.

This is a **Player-Coach** role. You will spend your time architecting complex solutions for our most strategic customers while simultaneously formalizing the "Medplum Way" of implementation to help our team scale.

## What You Will Do

- **Lead by Example:** Act as the lead architect for our most complex enterprise implementations. You will help customer engineering teams navigate build-vs-buy decisions and design their clinical data strategy on top of Medplum.
- **Formalize the FDE Playbook:** Take the "chaos" of early-stage implementations and turn them into a repeatable engine. You will define how we handle technical discovery, implementation sprints, and "go-live" milestones.
- **Bridge Product & Engineering:** You are the voice of the customer. You will translate real-world implementation bottlenecks into high-quality product requirements, helping the core team prioritize the roadmap based on what actually happens in the field.
- **Mentor & Scale the Team:** Provide technical leadership and mentorship to the FDE team. You will help recruit new FDEs and ensure they have the training and tools (SDKs, starter kits, documentation) to be successful.
- **Code the "Golden Paths":** Stay hands-on by contributing to our public repositories and creating "Golden Path" implementation examples that serve as the blueprint for the entire Medplum community.

## About You

- **The Technical Pedigree:** You have 6+ years of experience in high-stakes technical roles (Senior FDE, Staff Engineer, or Solutions Architect). You are a proficient coder in the **TypeScript/Node.js** ecosystem and aren't afraid to dive into the Medplum source code to unblock a customer.
- **Executive Presence:** You can command a room of C-suite executives at a major health system, translating Medplum's technical primitives into their business outcomes.
- **High Agency:** You are obsessed with customer success. If a customer is blocked, you feel it personally. You have the technical chops to unblock them yourself and the leadership skills to ensure the team learns from the experience.
- **SF-Based:** You are based in the Bay Area and value the high-bandwidth collaboration of being in-person with the founding team 2-3x/week.
