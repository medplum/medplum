# Engineering Manager

![Engineering Manager](/img/careers/engineering-manager.webp)

## About the Role

Medplum is seeking an **Engineering Manager** to lead our core platform team. As an open-source, developer-first platform, our "product" is our code, our APIs, and our architecture. We need a leader who balances technical fluency with the organizational skills required to build a high-velocity, high-trust engineering culture.

In this role, you will report to the CTO and take ownership of the day-to-day delivery and health of the engineering team. You will be responsible for the professional growth of our engineers, the reliability of our systems, and the continuous improvement of our development lifecycle. You are an ideal fit if you are a **hands-on leader** who thrives in the "weeds" of technical implementation while ensuring the team stays aligned and unblocked.

## What You Will Do

- **Engineering Mentorship:** Provide direct mentorship to a high-agency team of senior engineers. You will conduct regular 1:1s, facilitate career growth conversations, and foster a culture of high ownership and direct feedback.
- **Delivery & Execution:** Own the "rhythm" of the engineering team. You will manage sprint planning, triage, and resource allocation, ensuring we ship high-impact features predictably and with high quality.
- **Technical Stewardship:** Actively participate in code reviews and architectural design docs. While you won't be the primary IC for every feature, you are expected to stay technically sharp enough to identify edge cases in distributed systems or security vulnerabilities.
- **Operational Excellence:** Evolve our standards for testing, deployment, and on-call rotations. You will ensure that as we scale, our developer experience remains world-class and our infrastructure stays resilient.
- **Hiring & Onboarding:** Partner with the founders to recruit and interview top-tier talent. You will play a key role in designing our technical interview loops and ensuring new hires are integrated effectively into the Medplum codebase.
- **Security & Compliance:** In healthcare, "security is the product." You will ensure our daily engineering practices exceed the requirements for HIPAA, SOC2, and HITRUST.

## About You

- **Experience:** You have 6+ years of engineering experience, with at least 1-2 years of experience formally managing or leading a team in a high-growth environment.
- **Technical Foundation:** You are a senior-level engineer with a strong background in the **TypeScript/Node.js** ecosystem. You are comfortable diving into Postgres queries, AWS/CDK, and complex API designs.
- **Player-Coach Mentality:** You aren't looking to "exit the code." You enjoy the mix of people management and technical problem-solving.
- **Open Source Mindset:** You understand the unique challenges of building a public-facing platform. You value documentation, clean public APIs, and community engagement.
- **SF-Based:** You are based in the San Francisco Bay Area and value the high-bandwidth collaboration of being in-person with the team at least twice weekly.
