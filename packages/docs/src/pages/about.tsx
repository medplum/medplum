                We believe that a clean, secure, and compliant data infrastructure layer will elevate the entire field
                of healthcare innovation and make it possible for the top technical talent to focus on what’s next. We
                believe that interoperability is vital to the future of healthcare technology. And we believe that
                starting with a future-ready foundation will propel every healthcare innovator closer to better
                clinical, operational, and financial outcomes.
