# Integrations and Interoperability Engine

Medplum offers **a powerful integration and interoperability engine** that speaks common healthcare "languages" (FHIR, HL7, SFTP, CCD-A and more). This is **the most commonly used feature of Medplum**. It can be used to receive data from and send data to other systems - medical or cloud based.

Medplum integrations and interoperability is an **event-driven** service. It listens to notifications from medical systems like a laboratory information system or EHRs. The service logs data and supports persistence to a FHIR datastore as needed. It is [open source](https://github.com/medplum/medplum).

## Overview

Medplum enables many medical and non-medical services to be effectively composed, and so allows a powerful user-facing application to be built on top. Medplum provides the following **event-driven** functionality:

- **Listens** to notifications from systems like LIS, EHR, and webhook enabled webapps
- **Sends** notifications and data to external systems, triggered off events
- **Transforms** data via a custom scripting engine, enabling bespoke workflows
- **Stores** data, allowing applications like dashboards to be built
- **Logs** activity and version history, enabling debugging and traceability

Below is an **example of a medical practice "Foo Medical" with connections** to various systems. This is an example deployment, but can give a sense of what connections might be needed in practice.

## Creating Medical Integrations

Creating effective integrations often requires writing some code. We provide pre-built integrations, high level SDKs, testing framework, deployment and provisioning features that **greatly reduce the engineering burden to build, and to maintain integrations**.

Our integration framework is called bots and there are detailed [bots tutorials](/docs/bots) in our technical documentation.

Before starting an integration, we recommend filling out the following checklist

- [ ] What system are you trying to connect to?
- [ ] What type of interfaces are available? (Check multiple if appropriate)
  - [ ] FHIR or Smart-On-FHIR
  - [ ] REST API
  - [ ] HL7
  - [ ] SFTP
  - [ ] XML based, like CCD-A or CDISC
  - [ ] File based - text or binary (e.g. X12, images, video)
  - [ ] Delimited Text
  - [ ] Something else?
- [ ] How can you request credentials/access to a test environment?
- [ ] What process is required to gain access to production?

## Examples: Integrations by Interface Type

To get started integrating services into Medplum, it can be useful to think about **which type of medical applications have which type of interfaces**. Medplum provides the infrastructure that helps connect systems like these together.

This is by no means a comprehensive list, but we provide this list of interfaces as examples of tools and systems indexed by type of integration is commonly seen.

## Examples: Integrations by Product Category

To get a medical application to work as intended often requires many systems to talk to each other, each with a different function. Medplum enables connectivity to various systems, through the [Bot](/docs/bots) framework.

Below are some of the classes of applications indexed by common integration methods. Medplum supports building interfaces of this type to enable connectivity.
