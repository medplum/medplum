Medplum is a community, and advocacy for standards and open source implementations are core to our mission.  I’m writing today to share **Medplum’s support for [Stanford Biodesign](https://biodesign.stanford.edu/) [OpenCareHub](https://opencarehub.com/)’s proposal for [ARPA-H PARADIGM](https://arpa-h.gov/research-and-funding/programs/paradigm)**. 

There are three things that make this proposal noteworthy.

* ARPA-H PARADIGM is a government initiative, whose mission to **improve access to healthcare in rural communities**
* OpenCareHub will **open source their implementation**
* The initiative is led by an **interdisciplinary (clinical/technical) team** out of Stanford Biodesign, [Dr. Oliver Aalami](https://profiles.stanford.edu/oliver-aalami) and [Dr. Paul Schmiedmayer](https://profiles.stanford.edu/schmiedmayer) 

We would like to encourage those in the Medplum community to reach out if you need a letter of support for your engagement with government agencies like ARPA-H, NIH, CMS, FDA and more.  Contact us at hello@medplum.com.

We wrote a letter of support for the OpenCareHub team.  Good luck!
