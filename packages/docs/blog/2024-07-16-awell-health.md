# Awell clinical workflow automation on Medplum

[Awell](https://www.awellhealth.com/?utm_medium=partners&utm_source=website&utm_campaign=medplum-profile) is a low-code platform designed to enable your clinical teams to design, operate and continuously improve your care flows with minimal engineering lift.

Awell works seamlessly with Medplum to build and operate careflows. Connecting Medplum to your Awell care flows opens up limitless possibilities for automating, standardizing and coordinating care such as:

- Patient onboarding
- Send pre-consultation questionnaire to patient based on consultation date
- Send an automated [charting note](/docs/charting#capturing-notes) to Medplum based on a form filled in by a patient/care team member
- Send automated [chat messages](/docs/communications) via Medplum to patients based on input in the care flow (e.g. “Your consultation data is scheduled for 9 November at 3:30 PM ET, please don’t forget to list your medication before the consultation using this form)
- Automated follow-up
- Task coordination for care team members, and more.

## Problem

Are your clinical and product experts spending time mapping care flows in Miro or Lucidchart? Writing protocols in Google docs? If so, you’re having challenges with one or both of the following:

- Some of these flows live on as Google docs, PDFs & Flowchart and are used as such in clinical practice, resulting in operational inefficiencies and potential clinical errors.
- Some flows are hard-coded in patient and care team apps by the engineering team, resulting in slow time to market and a low ability to iterate.
- Clinical operations need to quickly build and test operational workflows quickly, in an environment where engineering resources are limited. They need a tool to visualize their workflow as well.

That’s where Awell comes in, to enable clinicians with a no-code tool that’s intuitive but flexible enough to enable even complex care. As we all know clinicians have limited time, and robust and auditable automations can really help them with their workflow.

## Solution

Awell authoring tool and Medplum record system together allow for a usable and powerful workflow experience with the following features:

- Start an Awell care flow based on events ([FHIR subscriptions](/docs/subscriptions)) received from Medplum
- Get data from Medplum into Awell care flows to enrich your flows and use the data in conditional logic, personalized reporting, risk score calculations etc
- Push data back or perform actions in Medplum triggered by an Awell care flow.
- Standards compliant FHIR data stored and managed on Medplum, and consumable via API or in the provider application.
- Highly auditable workflow with change history and audit logging available.
