# Medplum 2026 Roadmap:

As we kick off 2026, we're excited to share Medplum's vision for the year ahead. Our open-source healthcare development platform has experienced substantial growth throughout 2025:

<!-- truncate -->

As of December 2025:

- 500,000+ Docker downloads (up 2x from 2024)
- 161 GitHub contributors (up 40% from 2024)
- 2,100 GitHub stars

As informed by our community and customers, we are focusing on the following initiatives in 2026.

### Compliance (H1 2026)

Medplum is pursuing [HITRUST Certification](/docs/compliance/hitrust) for our hosted environment. We are also certifying changes related to [HTI-4](/docs/compliance/hti-4) to enable both providers and payers to comply with the mandate, with key milestones aligned to the January 2027 enforcement date.

These compliance primitives support hospital and health system connectivity and interoperability. The HTI-4 mandates are also important because they cover prior authorization for medications, professional billing, and facilities billing.

### Enterprise Scale & Infrastructure

Platform traffic on Medplum is growing quickly, and we are investing in several initiatives to achieve scale. We are implementing sharding and archiving capabilities to handle larger datasets efficiently. Data warehouse integration via Kafka will support high volume connections. We are also enhancing cross-cloud support for GCP, Azure, and AWS deployments.

### Scheduling

Scheduling is key to healthcare workflows, and we are investing heavily in making it great for a wide variety of use cases. This includes self-scheduling, advanced availability management, facilities scheduling, and resource scheduling.
