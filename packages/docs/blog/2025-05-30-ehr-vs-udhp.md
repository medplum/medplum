Healthcare technology relies on established systems like Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and is now incorporating concepts like Unified Digital Health Platforms (UDHPs). Understanding this evolution is key to navigating the industry's direction.

### EHRs: The Foundation and Its Boundaries

EHRs were pivotal in digitizing patient records and streamlining billing. While foundational, many traditional EHRs present limitations in flexible data sharing, adaptability to varied workflows, and support for modern, rapid development cycles. These boundaries are less a critique of their original design and more an acknowledgment of today's expanded healthcare needs.

### UDHPs: Expanding the Horizon

Unified Digital Health Platforms (UDHPs) represent a move to address these limitations. Unlike monolithic EHRs, a UDHP is envisioned as an ecosystem platform fostering interoperability (often via FHIR®), enabling seamless data flow, and providing robust APIs to spur innovation. The interest in UDHPs centers on their potential to create more connected and responsive healthcare experiences by extending capabilities rather than solely storing records.

### Realizing the UDHP Vision: Implementation Matters

The UDHP concept is promising, but its practical realization depends heavily on the implementation approach. Healthcare's inherent diversity—unique organizational workflows, existing tech stacks, and specific patient needs—means a one-size-fits-all UDHP solution often falls short. The "last-mile" challenge of tailoring the platform to these specific needs is critical.

### Medplum's Approach: A Developer-First UDHP Foundation

At Medplum, we believe a developer-first strategy is essential to effectively harness the UDHP model. Our open-source, FHIR-native platform functions as a "headless EHR," providing the core, secure, and compliant infrastructure. This empowers healthcare organizations and innovators to:

- **Build with Precision:** Develop applications and workflows tailored to their exact requirements.
- **Ensure Data Interoperability:** Leverage a FHIR-native data store for standardized and accessible information.
- **Automate Effectively:** Utilize an extensible framework to create custom automation for clinical and administrative processes.

This approach allows organizations to construct their own UDHP-powered solutions on a flexible foundation, ensuring the platform meets their unique needs and addresses integration challenges effectively.

### Building a Connected Future

The shift towards a UDHP model signifies a positive evolution, emphasizing greater connectivity and flexibility. Medplum is committed to supporting this evolution by providing robust, open tools for the builders who are shaping the future of healthcare technology.
