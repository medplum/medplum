## Medplum is a YC Company

Hello from [Medplum](https://www.medplum.com/)!

Medplum is an API-first Electronic Health Record - _**thatâ€™s open source**_, and today we are announcing that we are part of the [YC S22](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/?batch=S22) batch.

This announcement is extra special for us because this fall marks 10 years of YC for our team. Almost a decade ago, we were the founding team of [MedXT](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/medxt) (W13 acquired by Box) and I spent 2021 as a [Visiting Group Partner](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/welcome-w21-visiting-group-partners/) for the [W21](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?batch=W21) and [S21](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?batch=S21) batches.

Why are we back in YC?

- **Medical apps are notoriously hard to build and maintain**, largely due to all the stakeholders involved and the byzantine incentive system.
- We were **inspired by trailblazing open source YC companies** [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [PostHog](https://posthog.com/), [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/) and [many others](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/?tags=Open%20Source) who solve similar complex problems in other domains.
- We believe the **open source model will be especially impactful for healthcare**.

Medplum makes it fast and easy to build white label medical apps that look good and are compliant and integration-ready day one.
