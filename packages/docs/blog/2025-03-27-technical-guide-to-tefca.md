## Purpose

This white paper aims to provide a **technical guide for software developers and healthcare IT professionals seeking to integrate their systems with the Trusted Exchange Framework** **and Common Agreement** (TEFCA). It delves into the technical aspects of TEFCA, including the various participation models, QHIN connectivity, data exchange methods, and security considerations. It also explores the incentives for TEFCA participation and how Medplum can help organizations achieve TEFCA compliance and leverage its benefits.

## Background

The healthcare industry has long struggled with **fragmented data**, leading to **inefficiencies**, errors, and suboptimal patient care. TEFCA represents a step towards addressing these challenges by establishing a nationwide framework for secure and interoperable health information exchange[^1]. By participating in TEFCA, healthcare organizations can improve care coordination, reduce costs, and enhance patient outcomes[^2].

## Understanding the TEFCA Framework

TEFCA, enacted through the 21st Century Cures Act, aims to establish a **universal policy** and **technical floor** for nationwide interoperability[^3]. It seeks to simplify connectivity for organizations to securely exchange information to improve patient care, enhance the welfare of populations, and generate healthcare value[^3]. TEFCA operates as a "network of networks," connecting various Health Information Networks (HINs) across the country[^1]. These HINs, upon meeting specific criteria and undergoing a vetting process, are designated as Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs)[^4].


### TEFCA Goals

TEFCA has three primary goals:

1. Establish a **universal policy and technical framework** for nationwide interoperability.  
2. **Simplify connectivity** for organizations to securely exchange information.  
3. **Empower individuals (patients)** to gather their own health information[^3].

### Trusted Exchange Framework (TEF) Principles

The Trusted Exchange Framework (TEF) outlines seven foundational principles for trust policies and practices to facilitate data sharing among HINs:

1. **Standardization:** Prioritize the use of federally recognized and industry-acknowledged technical standards, policies, best practices, and procedures for a cohesive and efficient exchange ecosystem[^5].  
2. **Openness and Transparency:** QHINs should operate transparently, promoting stakeholder trust and fostering a collaborative environment[^5].  
3. **Cooperation and Non-discrimination:** QHINs should cooperate with each other and not discriminate against other HINs or participants[^5].  
4. **Privacy:** QHINs should prioritize the privacy of individuals' health information and comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations[^5].  
5. **Security and Safety:** QHINs should ensure the security and safety of health information exchange, protecting it from unauthorized access and disclosure[^5].  
6. **Access:** QHINs should facilitate and promote a clear understanding of how information has been used or disclosed while adhering to civil rights obligations on accessibility[^5].  
7. **Equity:** QHINs should consider the diverse impacts of interoperability on different populations and throughout the entire lifecycle of the activity, ensuring an inclusive approach[^5].

These principles guide the development and implementation of TEFCA, fostering a trustworthy and reliable health information exchange ecosystem.

### TEFCA Architecture

TEFCA operates as a "**network of networks**," connecting various Health Information Networks (HINs) across the country[^1]. These HINs, upon meeting specific criteria and undergoing a rigorous vetting process, are designated as Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs)[^4]. QHINs serve as facilitators of nationwide interoperability within the TEFCA framework, adhering to a common set of rules and technical specifications[^1].

Participants, such as healthcare providers, health systems,  payers, connect to a QHIN to engage in TEFCA exchange[^6]. Subparticipants, often members of a Participant's organization, can also connect to a QHIN through a Participant[^6]. This layered structure creates an interconnected network where data can flow seamlessly between different organizations and systems.

The following table illustrates the different ways an organization can participate in TEFCA:

| Participation Model | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| QHIN | A large HIN that serves as the backbone for nationwide interoperability, connecting to other QHINs and facilitating data exchange between its Participants and Subparticipants. |
| Participant | An organization that connects to a QHIN to engage in TEFCA exchange, typically a healthcare individual patient, provider, health system, government agency or payer. |
| Subparticipant | An organization that connects to a QHIN through a Participant, often a member of the Participant's organization. |

###

### Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs)

QHINs are the foundation of the TEFCA framework, responsible for ensuring secure and reliable health information exchange across the network[^1]. They play a crucial role in upholding the principles of TEFCA and ensuring compliance with the Common Agreement.

To become a QHIN, an organization must meet stringent requirements, including:

* **Ownership Requirements:** Being a U.S. entity with no foreign control that could pose a national security risk[^7].  
* **Exchange Requirements:** Demonstrating the capability to exchange Electronic Health Information (EHI) with multiple unaffiliated organizations, supporting all required exchange purposes, and adhering to non-discrimination policies[^7].  
* **Designated Network Services Requirements:** Maintaining a robust and secure network infrastructure, establishing data governance policies, and ensuring compliance with privacy and security standards[^8].

**QHIN Onboarding**

The QHIN onboarding process involves several steps to ensure the organization's readiness for participation in TEFCA exchange. This includes:

* **Application and Review:** Submitting a comprehensive application with supporting documentation and undergoing a thorough review by the Recognized Coordinating Entity (RCE)[^7].  
* **Testing:** Conducting tests to ensure the QHIN's network can connect to those of other QHINs[^7].  
* **Production Environment Integration:** Successfully integrating the QHIN's network into the TEFCA production environment and demonstrating the ability to exchange data with other QHINs[^7].

This rigorous onboarding process ensures that QHINs meet the technical and operational requirements for secure and reliable health information exchange within the TEFCA framework.

As of March 2025, eight organizations have been designated as QHINs:

| QHIN | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| CommonWell Health Alliance | A non-profit trade association focused on enabling nationwide health data exchange. |
| eHealth Exchange | A nationwide health information network that facilitates data exchange between federal agencies and private sector healthcare organizations. |
| Epic Nexus | A QHIN specifically for organizations using Epic's EHR systems. |
| Health Gorilla | A health information network that focuses on providing access to clinical data, including social determinants of health (SDOH) data. |
| KONZA National Network | A national health information network that enables data exchange across different care settings and communities. |

| eClinicalWorks | A QHIN specifically for organizations using eClinicalWorks' EHR systems. |

### Data Exchange Methods

TEFCA supports both document-based (CDA) and FHIR-based exchange methods to accommodate the diverse needs of healthcare organizations.

**Document-Based Exchange**

The initial iteration of TEFCA focuses on document-based exchange, leveraging existing standards and infrastructure[^9]. This involves the exchange of HL7 CDA documents, which are widely used in healthcare for sharing clinical information[^9]. TEFCA leverages Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) profiles, such as Cross-Community Patient Discovery (XCPD) and Cross-Community Access (XCA), to facilitate the secure retrieval of these documents[^5].

**FHIR-Based Exchange**

While the first iteration of TEFCA focuses on document-based exchange and supports facilitated FHIR exchange, FHIR is not mandatory at this time. Nevertheless a large number of Participants and Sub-participants voluntarily use FHIR as it addresses their needs best. Examples of such use cases included but not limited to Individual Access Services using SMART-on-FHIR and Electronic Case Reporting. More use cases and exchange purposes are on the roadmap for future development[^9]. The TEFCA FHIR roadmap outlines a phased approach for incorporating FHIR into TEFCA, with the goal of enabling more granular and standardized data exchange[^5]. This will allow developers to leverage FHIR APIs for accessing and exchanging data, promoting interoperability and innovation in healthcare applications.

### Patient Matching in TEFCA

Patient matching is a critical aspect of TEFCA, ensuring that the correct patient data is accessed and exchanged[^5]. Accurate patient matching is essential for preventing errors, improving care coordination, and ensuring the integrity of health information exchange.

TEFCA acknowledges the challenges of patient matching and plans to work with QHINs to create future patient-matching guidelines[^5]. This collaborative approach will help improve patient matching accuracy and consistency across the TEFCA network.
