2. Navigate to the [Project Admin](https://app.medplum.com/admin/project) page. 
3. Click on the "Users" tab
4. Click on the "Invite new user" link at the bottom of the screen.
5. Fill in the user details such as first name, last name, and email address.
6. For advanced security features, you can configure an [AccessPolicy](../security/access-control). An AccessPolicy allows you to specify which resource types users can read and write.
