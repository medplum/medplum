# Family Relationships

## Introduction

Delivering healthcare often involves more than a single patient. Spouses, parents, children, siblings, and even friends can be involved in delivering care, participating in clinical activities, and providing financial support.

The FHIR spec provides a number of Resources for modeling a patient's relationship to other individuals, but how you use these tools will depend on your specific clinical setting and workflow.

This guide provides a framework to help you decide which resources to use to model your patients' family relationships, and recommends a few approaches that our users have found useful.

:::info Note

In this guide we will use the term "family member" throughout, as the most common use case is to model families. However, this similar data models can be used to model legal guardians, non-family caregivers, and any other individual related to the patient.

## Use Cases

- Pediatric Health
- Family Medicine
- Group Therapy
- Maternal Health
- Clinical Trials and Population Health

## This guide will show you

1. The key FHIR Resources used to model relationships.
2. A decision guide for how to choose the right data modeling approach.
3. A set recommended approaches for modeling family relationships in FHIR.
4. Example use cases and queries for each approach.

## Key Resources

|                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Patient**](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient)             | This is the resource that models a human who receives clinical services, such as diagnostic labs, medications, and procedures.                                                                                                  |
| [**RelatedPerson**](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson) | This models the _relationship between two people_. For simple use cases, you can store demographic and contact information directly in the [RelatedPerson](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson) resource itself (see below). |
| [**Person**](/docs/api/fhir/resources/person)               | This resources can serves as a store for a common set of biographical and contact information about an individual person who is not the subject of any clinical activities.                                                     |
| [**Group**](/docs/api/fhir/resources/group)                 | The [Group](/docs/api/fhir/resources/group) resource provides a single resource to reference a collection of individuals. It can be used to model the family unit as a whole instead of a collection of individual resources.   |

## Decision Guide

How you decide to model family relationships will depend on your clinical setting, your processes, and your patient population. Below, we provide a few best-practice modeling approaches, as well as some questions you can answer to figure out which approach fits your use case the best.

Note that these are just starting points - you can mix and match these strategies to model your data according to your use case

### Do family members participate in clinical or financial activities? {#family-member-participation}

The first question you should ask yourself is whether you need to keep track of family members' participation in **clinical or financial activities**.

Some examples of such participation include:

- Family members attend office visits with the patient
- A family member is the primary policyholder on the patient's insurance
- A family member is responsible for administering care or medication to the patient
- Family members undergo diagnostic testing or medical imaging to help diagnose and treat the patient

In many use cases, family members _do not_ participate in clinical and financial activities, but rather serve as only points of contact. In those situations, [Approach #1](#approach-1) provides a simple modeling approach that avoids the use of many different resource types.

### How often will Patients share family members? {#are-family-members-shared}

If your patients' family members _do_ participate in clinical/billing activities, the next question is how often patients share family members. This tends to happen more frequently in pediatric and family medicine settings. For example, two siblings might be enrolled as separate patients in a pediatric clinic, but they share the same mother and father.

In these situations, it is desireable to "factor out" store demographic and contact information for each family member into a single resource, to make it easier to maintain, as outlined in [Approach #3](#approach-3). However, these approaches have some additional complexity since they another resource type to the model.

### Is the subject of the treatment an individual patient, or a family unit? {#family-unit-vs-individual-patient}

In most cases, the focus of each clinical activity will be a single patient, even if an overall care plan involves multiple related patients. However, in some cases, the beneficiary of the treatment is the family unit as a whole, not the individual members. This is most common in family or group counseling scenarios (such as Alcoholics Anonymous), where the clinical objective is to help treat the interpersonal relationships between family members, rather than any specific individual.

In these instances, you can create a [Group](/docs/api/fhir/resources/group) resource with all the Patients who are the focus of the activity, and treat the [Group](/docs/api/fhir/resources/group) as a single clinical  unit, as detailed in [Approach #4](#approach-4).

## Data Models

After you've answered these questions about your use case, you're ready to make some decisions on how to model your family relationships. Below, we've outlined a few data modeling schemes, but these are not mutually exclusive. You may choose to mix and match the schemes to better suit your needs.

### Approach #1: [Patient](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient) with Contact Information {#approach-1}

    })(LisaSimpson),
    null,
    2
  )}
  `}

</Tabs>

If your family members do not participate in clinical/billing activities and patients rarely share family members, the simplest approach is just to store information about family members directly on the [Patient](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient) resource.

The `Patient.contact` property can store a list the following information about each family member:

| Information       | Property                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Name              | `Patient.contact[i].name`         |
| Gender            | `Patient.contact[i].gender`       |
| Address           | `Patient.contact[i].address`      |
| Phone Number      | `Patient.contact[i].telecom`      |
| Email             | `Patient.contact[i].telecom`      |
| Relationship Type | `Patient.contact[i].relationship` |

The benefits of this approach is that you only have to manage one resource type, the [Patient](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient), which makes your API calls very simple.

The tradeoff is that if patients share family members (e.g. siblings share the same parents), you'll have to duplicate that family's contact information on each [Patient](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient)

If family members _do_ participate in clinical/billing activities, then it might make sense to model them explicitly as a separate resource to track their individual participation.

You can model a family member explicitly as a [RelatedPerson](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson) resource. The [RelatedPerson](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson) has one required field, `RelatedPerson.patient`, which is a reference to the target patient. The `RelatedPerson.relationship` property is a [CodeableConcept](/docs/fhir-basics#codeable-concepts-standarding-data) that can be used to specify the relationship type. In simple use cases where patients rarely share family members, then you can store basic demographic information and contact information directly in the [RelatedPerson](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson) resource.

The benefit of this approach is that you can track the family member's role in clinical and billing activities independently of the patient.

The tradeoff is that is that you need to maintain the [RelatedPerson](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson) resource in addition the [Patient](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient) Resource.

:::info Note

Each [RelatedPerson](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson) can only have **one** patient associated with them it. This is because [RelatedPerson](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson) is meant to model the _relationship_ between a family member and a patient. Even if two patients the same family member, you'll have to create a new [RelatedPerson](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson) for each (patient, family member) pair to model each relationship.

If your practice begins to have patients who share family members, duplicating their contact information across multiple [RelatedPerson](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson) resources can quickly become error prone.

For example, consider two Patients who are siblings and share the same mother. Because a [RelatedPerson](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson) resource models the relationship between a person and a [Patient](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient), each sibling would need it's own [RelatedPerson](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson) resource linking them to the mother (as shown the the diagram). However, [Approach #2](#approach-2) duplicates the mother's contact information on each [RelatedPerson](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson). If the family moves, you will have to ensure that this address information is updated in both places.

To avoid this duplication, we can "factor out" the mother's demographic and contact information into a separate [Patient](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient) resource. The [Patient](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient) is then connected to the [RelatedPerson](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson) using the `Patient.link.other` property (with `Patient.link.type` set to `"seealso"`). This avoids the data duplication, at the expense of adding one more layer of indirection.

In this model, the [RelatedPerson](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson) does not store specific information about the mother. It only stores the _relationship_ betwen the mother and child.

:::info Note

The FHIR spec also allows the use of the [Person](/docs/api/fhir/resources/person) resource to factor out demographic information. While this is a reasonable approach in cases where an individual can be both a [Patient](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient) and a [Practitioner](/docs/api/fhir/resources/practitioner), Medplum generally doesn't recommend the additional complexity of mixing [Patient](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient) and [Person](/docs/api/fhir/resources/person) resources.

For some use cases, it is useful to keep track of the family unit as a whole, rather than as a web of connected [Patients](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient), [RelatedPersons](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson), and [Persons](/docs/api/fhir/resources/person).

The [Group](/docs/api/fhir/resources/group) resources allows you to specify a single resource that represents the of people as a single unit, and in some places can be used in place of the [Patient](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient) resource. Some common examples are:

| Use Case                                                                                                          | [Group](/docs/api/fhir/resources/group) referenced by                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Family therapy office visit where the subject of the visit is the entire family, not just the individual members. | `Encounter.subject`                                                              |
| Measuring the effects of a drug administered to a patient population during a clinical trial.                     | `Condition.subject`<br />`MedicationDispense.subject`<br />`Observation.subject` |

For a group of specific individuals, each group member is referenced in the `Group.member.entity` property.

You can also use the [Group](/docs/api/fhir/resources/group) resource to model abstract groups, where the specific members are not clinically or financially relevant. To indicate that the group us abstract, set `Group.actual` to `false`.

Some examples of abstract groups are:

- A support group like Alcoholics Anonymous.
- A generalized population of patients for a clinical trial.
- A herd of animals for veterinary use cases.

Adding a [Group](/docs/api/fhir/resources/group) resource for your families an orthogonal choice to Approaches #1-3. You may choose to model the individual relationships via [RelatedPersons](/docs/api/fhir/resources/relatedperson) _and_ also consolidate the entire family into a group. If modeling family groups is important, Medplum recommends modeling all the individuals as Patients, and then referencing them in the `Group.member.entity` array.

In the case of abstract groups, you can use the `Group.quantity` field to record the size of the group, which may be important for analytics or billing workflows.
