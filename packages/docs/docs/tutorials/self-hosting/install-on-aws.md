## Setup

Most AWS resources are automatically created using CDK, but some either cannot or are not recommended. Please follow these initial setup steps to prepare your account.

### Create HTTPS certificates

You will need the ARN for [ACM Certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html) for the following hosts:

1. App (i.e., app.example.com)
2. API (i.e., api.example.com)
3. Storage (i.e., storage.example.com)

Follow the [Requesting a public certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html) guide three times, one for each certificate.

While CDK can provision certificates, it is not recommended.

### Create a signing key

<details>
  <summary>Why do I need a signing key?</summary>
  <div>
    <p>Medplum uses S3 and CloudFront for binary content such as images, videos, and other file attachments.  To serve this content, the API server generates <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-signed-urls.html">AWS CloudFront signed URLs</a> which are valid for a configurable period of time.</p>
    <p>AWS CloudFront signed URLs have many desirable properties.  They are fast and virtually infinitely scalable.  They work well with standard web techniques such as `&lt;img&gt;` and `&lt;video&gt;` tags.  They support HTTP Range Requests for optimal video performance.</p>
  </div>
</details>

Generate a 2048 bit RSA key:

```sh
openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
```

Export the public key to a file:

```sh
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
```

For more details, see [AWS CloudFront - Using signed URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-signed-urls.html).

### Add the signing key to CloudFront

Follow the [Creating key pairs for your signers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-trusted-signers.html#private-content-creating-cloudfront-key-pairs) guide to add your signing key to CloudFront.

Make note of the key ID for future steps.

### Create a S3 bucket for logging

Follow the [Creating a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html) guide to create an S3 bucket for logging. All log backups will be stored in this directory.

### Create a SES email address

Follow the [Creating and verifying identities in Amazon SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html) guide to register an email address for system generated emails.

### Create a CDK config file

Create a Medplum CDK config file. This is a JSON file that contains all of the custom infrastructure configuration settings of the new environment. Note that this is distinct from the server config file (see next section).

Here is a full example. See the table below for details on each setting.

| Key                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Create a server config

Create a Medplum server config in AWS Parameter Store.

> **_TODO:_** Write documentation for how to use JSON config file format with Docker and CDK. It is technically possible using either a custom Dockerfile or a Docker layer on top of the official Medplum Docker image. It would require modifying the `MedplumTaskDefinition` `command` in `backend.ts`.

When running Medplum server on a local developer machine, Medplum server typically loads config settings from a JSON config file. By default, it loads config settings from `medplum.config.json`.

When running in AWS, Medplum server loads config settings from AWS Parameter Store, a feature of AWS Systems Manager (SSM).

Some configuration settings are created automatically by the CDK deployment (for example, database and redis connection details). Other settings must be created manually before the first deploy.

When creating a parameter in AWS Parameter Store, you will be prompted for the parameter **Name**. The parameter **Name** uses the convention `/medplum/{environmentName}/{key}`.

For example, if your environment name is "prod", then the "baseUrl" parameter name is `/medplum/prod/baseUrl`.

| Key                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                       | Automatic |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `port`                 | The port number that the API server binds to inside the Docker image. By default, you should use `8103`. In some cases, you may need to use `5000`.                               | no        |
| `baseUrl`              | The fully qualified base URL of the API server including a trailing slash. For example, `https://api.example.com/`.                                                               | no        |
| `issuer`               | The JWK issuer. By default, Medplum server uses built in OAuth, so `issuer` should be the same as `baseUrl`.                                                                      | no        |
