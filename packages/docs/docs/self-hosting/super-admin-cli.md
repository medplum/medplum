# Super Admin CLI

Medplum includes a CLI (Command Line Interface).

The main docs for the CLI are available here: https://github.com/medplum/medplum/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md

## Installation

As described in the docs, you can install globally:

```bash
npm install --global @medplum/cli
```

Or add as a package dependency:

```bash
npm install @medplum/cli
```

This document assumes that the CLI is installed globally, and therefore can be run simply as `medplum`.

If you install it as a package dependency, then you will need to prefix with `npx` such as `npx medplum`.

## Base URL

By default, the Medplum CLI connects to the Medplum hosted API at https://api.medplum.com/

You can use the `MEDPLUM_BASE_URL` to connect to your own hosted servers.

Check the current value:

```bash
echo $MEDPLUM_BASE_URL
```

Set a new value:

```bash
export MEDPLUM_BASE_URL=https://api.medplum.example.com
```

## Authentication

Use one of these authentication options:

1. Stored credentials in `~/.medplum/credentials`. You can use the `medplum login` command (see below) to automatically create this file.
2. Client credentials in environment variables `MEDPLUM_CLIENT_ID` and `MEDPLUM_CLIENT_SECRET`. dotenv is enabled, so you can store them in a .env file.

Check if logged in:

```bash
medplum whoami
```

Start a new login:

```bash
medplum login
```

Verify that the login worked:

```bash
medplum whoami
```

## User Management

The Medplum CLI supports RESTful CRUD operations. We can use that functionality to perform basic user management.

List users:

```bash
medplum get User
```

Search user by email:

```bash
medplum get User?email=fred@example.com
```

Get a user by ID

```bash
medplum get User/47394216-2bd5-445a-ad3c-b205bb56a0dc
```

The syntax of the last argument is either a FHIR resource/id or a FHIR search. All FHIR search parameters are supported in the CLI.

## Project Management

Similar to User Management, the CLI can use RESTful CRUD operations to perform basic project management.

List projects

```bash
medplum get Project
```

Search for project by name:

```bash
medplum get Project?name=staging
```

Get a project by ID:

```bash
medplum get Project/f4d16028-3de1-4473-bf66-899461b658c6
```

Projects also have special "operations". The URL syntax follows the FHIR operation model.

Use the $clone operation to clone a project:

```bash
medplum post 'Project/bca80725-ea6a-4fb4-8eac-41b8ee51f09e/$clone'
```

:::tip

Note that "$" is a special character in Bash for variable interpolation. Wrap the full string in single quotes to avoid interpolation, or escape the $ with a backslash.

:::

The result of the clone operation will be the new Project JSON:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Project",
  "name": "My Project",
  "id": "cabd683a-dc09-492f-a513-416c6f3c16bd",
  "meta": {
    "versionId": "a9ce32d9-c609-4814-bb67-59f3ea8b5d38",
    "lastUpdated": "2023-03-15T18:50:49.882Z"
  }
}
```

You can now add users to the new project using the admin invite endpoint to invite a user. The invite endpoint will use an existing User if one already exists with the specified email address. Otherwise, a new User will be created.

```bash
medplum post admin/projects/cabd683a-dc09-492f-a513-416c6f3c16bd/invite '{ \
    "resourceType": "Practitioner", \
    "firstName": "Bob", \
    "lastName": "Jones", \
    "email": "bob@example.com" \
}'
```

Expunge a project completely:

:::danger

This command permanently deletes all data in the project. This is irreversible. This is the equivalent of `sudo rm -rf`, so please use extreme caution.

:::

```bash
medplum post 'Project/bca80725-ea6a-4fb4-8eac-41b8ee51f09e/$expunge'
```
