# AWS CDK Settings Reference

When deploying Medplum on AWS using the provided CDK, you will need to create a configuration file to define your infrastructure settings. This is a JSON file that contains all of the custom infrastructure configuration settings for your environment.

Here is a full example for the Medplum staging environment. See the detailed information for each setting below.

```json

### name

The short name of your environment. This should be unique among your Medplum deployments. This will be used as part of Parameter Store path and CloudWatch Logs path. For example, `prod` or `staging`.

### stackName

The long name of your environment. This will be included in many of the AWS resource names created by CDK. For example, `MyMedplumStack` or `MedplumStagingStack`.

### accountNumber

### apiInternetFacing

Optional flag that controls whether the load balancer has an internet-routable address. Default is `true`.

### apiWafIpSetArn

### serverImage

The DockerHub server image to deploy. Use `medplum/medplum-server:4.0` for the most recent version published by the Medplum team. Or use your own repository if you need to deploy a custom instance.

### serverMemory

The amount (in MiB) of memory used by the ECS/Fargate instance. For example, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, etc. See [Task size](#task-size).

### fargateAutoScaling

**Fargate** is an AWS serverless compute engine for containers, meaning you don't have to manage any underlying infrastructure

Example:

```ts
fargateAutoScaling: {
  minCapacity: 1,
  maxCapacity: 10,
  targetUtilizationPercent: 50,
  scaleInCooldown: 60,
  scaleOutCooldown: 60,
}
```

**Fargate Auto Scaling**
| Option                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| minCapacity              | The minimum number of tasks that will be run at all times. This ensures that there are always some tasks running, even if the target utilization is not being met.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| maxCapacity              | The maximum number of tasks that can be run simultaneously. This limits the number of tasks that can be scaled up to meet demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| targetUtilizationPercent | The target value for the average CPU utilization of the tasks, in percentage. When setting up autoscaling, you define a target utilization percentage, and AWS adjusts the number of tasks to maintain this target. For example, if you set a target CPU utilization of 70%, AWS will scale up tasks when the CPU usage is above 70% and scale down when it's below that threshold.                                                 |
| scaleInCooldown          | The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale in event that scaling activities are ignored. This is so you don't see a low CPU spike and then immediately scale in again. This cooldown period helps to ensure that your application remains stable and doesn't experience frequent fluctuations in task counts. It gives the system time to stabilize before any further scaling actions are taken.                               |
| scaleOutCooldown         | The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale out event that scaling activities are ignored. This is so you don't see a high CPU spike and then immediately scale out again. This cooldown period helps to ensure that your application remains stable and doesn't experience frequent fluctuations in task counts. It gives the system time to stabilize before any further scaling actions are taken.                              |

## Task Size

A certain amount of server CPU and memory is required to validate resources on write, and having an underpowered server
instance may result in excessive garbage collection pressure and degraded performance. The recommended server task
configurations are shown below:

|                                            | `serverCpu` | `serverMemory` |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| Recommended for production                 | 4096        | 8192           |
| Minimum for production                     | 2048        | 4096           |
| Minimum for development or small workloads | 512         | 2048           |

Beyond the recommended instance size for production, the server may not be able to take advantage of additional CPU and
memory resources; instead of increasing these settings further, adding more instances with `desiredServerCount` is the
recommended way to improve performance if the server CPU is a performance bottleneck.
