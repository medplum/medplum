# Capturing Vital Signs

Vital signs are a group of important medical signs that measure the body's most vital (life-sustaining) functions, including blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration rate, and body temperature. Capturing these signs is a common part of many procedures, so it is important to ensure that they are being recorded and stored accurately.

## The `Observation` Resource

Vital signs are stored as [`Observation`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation) resources. To track the specific vital that is being observed, use the `Observation.code` element. This describes what was observed, and is sometimes called the observation &quot;name&quot;. This should be coded using [LOINC](/docs/careplans/loinc) codes per US core guidelines.

| **Element**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Code System**                                                                                     | **Example**                                      |

To record the actual _value_ of a measurement, you can use one of the various `value` fields on the `Observation` resource. There are fields for `valueQuantity`, `valueString`, `valueBoolean` and more.

:::tip Note on units

The `valueQuantity` field is stored as a `Quantity` type, which contains a `value` field to represent the numerical value and a `unit` field, which is a human readable unit that defines what is measured. Whenever possible, the unit should be coded using [Unified Codes for Units of Measure (UCUM)](https://ucum.org/).

## Observation Datatypes

`Observation` resources can be measured in many different ways. To account for this, the `value[x]` fields provide multiple ways to account for different datatypes.

## Using `valueSampledData` for Timeseries Data

The `valueSampledData` field is recommended for storing **dense timeseries observation data** from devices such as wearables (e.g., smartwatches, fitness trackers, continuous glucose monitors). This datatype efficiently represents a series of measurements taken at regular intervals within a single `Observation` resource.

### When to Use `valueSampledData`

Use `valueSampledData` when you have:
- Multiple measurements taken at regular intervals (e.g., heart rate readings every minute)
- Data from wearable devices or continuous monitoring equipment
- Timeseries data that would otherwise require creating many individual `Observation` resources

:::warning Large-Scale Wearables Data

**Medplum is not designed for large-scale wearables data ingestion.** While `valueSampledData` is suitable for moderate-frequency timeseries data (e.g., hourly or daily summaries), applications that need to store high-frequency data from many devices simultaneously (e.g., second-by-second readings from thousands of wearables) should consider using a dedicated data warehouse solution.

For large-scale wearables data:
- Use Medplum for clinical summaries and aggregated observations
- Stream raw high-frequency data to a time-series database or data warehouse

:::

### Structure of `SampledData`

The `SampledData` datatype includes:
- `origin`: The base value and unit (as a `Quantity`)
- `period`: The number of milliseconds between samples
- `dimensions`: The number of values per sample period
- `factor`: A scaling factor applied to the data
- `data`: A space-separated string of compressed sample values

    // Each value represents the difference from the origin (60 bpm)
    // So "5" = 65 bpm, "3" = 63 bpm, etc.
  }
}
```

### Helper Functions

Medplum provides helper functions in `@medplum/core` for working with `valueSampledData`:

#### `expandSampledData()`

Expands a `SampledData` object into an array of numeric values:

```typescript
import { expandSampledData } from '@medplum/core';

const sampledData = {
  origin: { value: 60, unit: 'beats/min' },
  period: 60000,
  dimensions: 1,
  factor: 1,
  data: '5 3 2 4 1'
};

const values = expandSampledData(sampledData);
// Returns: [65, 63, 62, 64, 61]
```

#### `expandSampledObservation()`

Converts an `Observation` with `valueSampledData` into multiple individual `Observation` resources, one for each data point:

```typescript
import { expandSampledObservation } from '@medplum/core';

const observation = {
  resourceType: 'Observation',
  code: { /* ... */ },
  valueSampledData: { /* ... */ },
  effectiveDateTime: '2024-01-15T08:00:00Z'
};

const expandedObservations = expandSampledObservation(observation);
// Returns an array of Observation resources, each with a valueQuantity
// and effectiveDateTime calculated from the sampled data
```

#### `summarizeObservations()` and `DataSampler`

Summarize multiple `Observation` resources into a single summary `Observation` with the original data points preserved in `component.valueSampledData`:

```typescript
import { summarizeObservations, DataSampler } from '@medplum/core';

// Option 1: Using summarizeObservations helper
const observations = [/* array of Observation resources */];
const summary = summarizeObservations(
  observations,
  { text: 'Average Heart Rate' },
  (data) => data.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / data.length
);

// Option 2: Using DataSampler class for more control
const sampler = new DataSampler({
  code: { text: 'Heart Rate' },
  unit: { unit: 'beats/min', code: '{Beats}/min' }
});

sampler.addObservation(obs1);
sampler.addObservation(obs2);
// ... add more observations

const summary = sampler.summarize(
  { text: 'Average Heart Rate' },
  (data) => data.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / data.length
);
```

## Multi-component Observations

In some cases it is possible for an `Observation` to have multiple "sub-observations". The `Observation.component` field can be used in these cases when there are multiple results that cannot be reasonably interpreted individually.

The `component` element should only be used when there is one method, one observation, one performer, one device, and one time.

:::caution

While creating sub-observations can provide powerful functionality, it can be complex to maintain and operationalize. It is recommended to only use the `component` field when absolutely necessary.

:::

A classic example of a multi-component `Observation` is systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

      },
    },
  ],
}
```

## Reference Ranges

The `Observation.referenceRange` element is a range of values that corresponds to what is considered normal for a _specific_ patient given their age, gender, race, etc.

The set of all possible values for a `referenceRange` is defined in the `ObservationDefinition` resource and is usually set up by clinical administrators. For more details, see the [`Observation` Reference Ranges docs](/docs/careplans/reference-ranges).
