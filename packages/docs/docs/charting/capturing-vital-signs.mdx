# Capturing Vital Signs

Vital signs are a group of important medical signs that measure the body's most vital (life-sustaining) functions, including blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration rate, and body temperature. Capturing these signs is a common part of many procedures, so it is important to ensure that they are being recorded and stored accurately.

## The `Observation` Resource

Vital signs are stored as [`Observation`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation) resources. To track the specific vital that is being observed, use the `Observation.code` element. This describes what was observed, and is sometimes called the observation &quot;name&quot;. This should be coded using [LOINC](https://www.medplum.com/docs/careplans/loinc) codes per US core guidelines.

| **Element**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Code System**                                                                                     | **Example**                                      |

To record the actual _value_ of a measurement, you can use one of the various `value` fields on the `Observation` resource. There are fields for `valueQuantity`, `valueString`, `valueBoolean` and more.

:::tip Note on units

The `valueQuantity` field is stored as a `Quantity` type, which contains a `value` field to represent the numerical value and a `unit` field, which is a human readable unit that defines what is measured. Whenever possible, the unit should be coded using [Unified Codes for Units of Measure (UCUM)](https://ucum.org/).

## Observation Datatypes

`Observation` resources can be measured in many different ways. To account for this, the `value[x]` fields provide multiple ways to account for different datatypes.

## Multi-component Observations

In some cases it is possible for an `Observation` to have multiple "sub-observations". The `Observation.component` field can be used in these cases when there are multiple results that cannot be reasonably interpreted individually.

The `component` element should only be used when there is one method, one observation, one performer, one device, and one time.

:::caution

While creating sub-observations can provide powerful functionality, it can be complex to maintain and operationalize. It is recommended to only use the `component` field when absolutely necessary.

:::

A classic example of a multi-component `Observation` is systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

## Reference Ranges

The `Observation.referenceRange` element is a range of values that corresponds to what is considered normal for a _specific_ patient given their age, gender, race, etc.

The set of all possible values for a `referenceRange` is defined in the `ObservationDefinition` resource and is usually set up by clinical administrators. For more details, see the [`Observation` Reference Ranges docs](https://www.medplum.com/docs/careplans/reference-ranges).
