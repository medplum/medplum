# Access Token Management

This guide explains how Medplum manages authentication tokens and how to implement secure token handling in your applications.

## Access Tokens vs Refresh Tokens

Medplum uses two types of tokens to manage authentication securely:

**Access Tokens** are short-lived JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that grant access to Medplum APIs. Each access token contains essential information about the user's permissions and session details. Every API request must include a valid access token.

**Refresh Tokens** are long-lived credentials used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to log in again. These tokens are stored securely by client applications and are only transmitted when requesting a new access token.

### Requesting Refresh Tokens

Refresh tokens are not issued by default. To receive a refresh token, you must include one of the following scopes in your authentication request:

- `offline_access`
- `offline`

For example:

<MedplumCodeBlock language="ts" selectBlocks="emailPasswordLogin" showLineNumbers>
  {ExampleCode}
</MedplumCodeBlock>

<MedplumCodeBlock language="ts" selectBlocks="oauthLogin" showLineNumbers>
  {ExampleCode}
</MedplumCodeBlock>

## Configuring Token Lifetimes

### Default Token Lifetimes

| Token Type | Default Lifetime          |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Access     | 3600 seconds (1 hour)     |
| Refresh    | 1209600 seconds (2 weeks) |

### Customizing Token Lifetimes

You can adjust token lifetimes by configuring your [`ClientApplication`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/clientapplication) resource. Custom token lifetimes are useful when your application has specific security requirements or usage patterns.

Here's how to modify token lifetimes:

<MedplumCodeBlock language="ts" selectBlocks="tokenLifetimes" showLineNumbers>
  {ExampleCode}
</MedplumCodeBlock>

:::warning

Consider your security requirements carefully when adjusting these values. Longer access token lifetimes increase convenience but also increase the window of vulnerability if a token is compromised.

## Managing Token Refresh with Grace Periods

The Medplum client includes a token refresh system that helps prevent service interruptions. The system uses a "grace period" to proactively refresh tokens before they expire.

### How Grace Periods Work

The grace period represents how long before expiration the client should attempt to refresh the token. By default, this is set to 5 minutes (300,000 milliseconds). For example, if your access token expires at 2:00 PM, the client will attempt to refresh it starting at 1:55 PM.

The Medplum client automatically handles token refresh in three scenarios:

1. Before making API requests when the token is within the grace period
2. When receiving a 401 Unauthorized response from the server
3. When your code explicitly requests a refresh

:::warning Grace Period Limitations

Note that the grace period mechanism only triggers in the above scenarios.

This means that if your application is idle (not making any API calls), tokens can expire even with a configured grace period. The grace period does not create background refresh tasks.

This is particularly important for mobile applications where the user may not interact with the app for extended periods of time.

For example:

1. User logs in at 1:00 PM with a 1-hour access token (expires 2:00 PM)
2. Application is idle from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM
3. At 2:30 PM when activity resumes, the token will have expired

To handle this scenario, you should:

- Check authentication status when resuming activity
- Refresh the token if needed before making requests
- Consider increasing the access token lifetime to reduce the frequency of token refreshes

### Customizing the Grace Period

You can adjust the grace period when initializing the Medplum client:

<MedplumCodeBlock language="ts" selectBlocks="graceCustomization" showLineNumbers>
  {ExampleCode}
</MedplumCodeBlock>

## Best Practices for Token Management

1. **Use Short-Lived Access Tokens**

   Keep access token lifetimes short (1-2 hours maximum) to minimize the impact of token theft. The Medplum client's automatic refresh mechanism means you don't need long-lived access tokens for continuous operation.

2. **Leverage Automatic Token Refresh**

   The Medplum client handles token refresh automatically. Configure the grace period appropriately for your application's needs:

   <MedplumCodeBlock language="ts" selectBlocks="bestPractices" showLineNumbers>
     {ExampleCode}
   </MedplumCodeBlock>

3. **Token Revocation**

   If you suspect a token has been compromised, revoke it immediately using the `/auth/logout` endpoint. Monitor your audit logs for suspicious activity that might indicate compromised tokens.
