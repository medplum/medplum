# Open Patient Registration

## Introduction

Most patient facing healthcare apps ask patients to self-enroll through a registration flow.

Medplum projects can be easily configured to allow open patient registration so that patients can sign up for Medplum accounts without being invited by a project administrator.

## Enabling Open Patient Registration

To enable open patient registration:

1. **Create a Patient [`AccessPolicy`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/accesspolicy)** - Open registration requires patients to have an access policy to restrict them to only viewing their own data. prevent them from accessing data for others patients and sensitive system level resources like [`AccessPolicy`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/accesspolicy). See [this example](/docs/auth/access-control#patient-access) for a good starting point for a patient access policy.
2. **Set the [`AccessPolicy`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/accesspolicy) as the default** - Navigate to https://app.medplum.com/Project and select your project. In the "Edit" tab, set the "Default Patient Access Policy" field to your new policy and click "Save".
