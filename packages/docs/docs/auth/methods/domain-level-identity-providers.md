# Domain-level Identity Providers

A Domain-level Identity Provider (DL-IDP) is a server-level configuration that sets up an external identity provider for all users from a given domain. This identity provider will be used for *all* Medplum applications the user logs into, **including the Medplum App**. Domain-level providers are primarily used to ensure that all practitioners access Medplum data via your corporate identity solution.

Once a DL-IDP is enabled for mydomain.com, any user that attempts to sign in with an email on that domain (name@mydomain.com) will be prompted to authenticate using the configured provider. Enabling DL-IDPs will apply to *all* emails at that domain, including dev accounts and name+text@mydomain.com type emails.

This guide demonstrates how to set up a DL-IDP, using Okta as an example provider.

:::caution Note

Setting up DL-IDPs on the Medplum Hosted instance requires an Enterprise account. If [self-hosting](/docs/self-hosting), setting it up requires super admin privileges.

:::

## Example: Setting up Okta as a Domain-level Identity Provider

### Okta Setup

Enabling Okta requires configuration on the Okta side and the Medplum side. You will need to be an Okta admin to set up a App Integration on Okta.

Click on "Create App Integration"

![Okta Applications Page](/img/auth/okta-applications.png)

When prompted, choose "**OIDC - OpenID Connect**" and "**Web Application**". Click "**Next**".

![Okta App Integration Page](/img/auth/okta-app-integration.png)

Use the following settings:

- App integration name: Choose your preferred name, or "Medplum"
- Grant Type
  - üî≤ Client Credentials - unchecked
  - ‚òëÔ∏è Authorization Code - checked
  - üî≤ Refresh Token - unchecked
  - üî≤ Implicit (hybrid) - unchecked
- Sign-in redirect URIs
  - üî≤ Allow wildcard - unchecked
  - Callback URL - "{medplumApiServerBaseUrl}/auth/external"
    - For example:
      - Medplum hosted apiServerBaseUrl is "https://api.medplum.com"
      - So the callback URL is "https://api.medplum.com/auth/external"
- Sign-out redirect URIs: Leave blank
- Trusted Origins: Leave blank

Scroll down to the Assignments section:

- Assignments
  - Controlled access
    - Choose the level appropriate for your organization
    - We recommend "Allow everyone in your organization to access" as a an account on Medplum is still required to be able to access
  - ‚òëÔ∏è Enable immediate access - checked

Then click "Save".

![Okta Assignments Page](/img/auth/okta-assignments.png)

On the next page, note the "Client ID" and "Client Secret", take note of those - they will be needed for the Medplum set up.

### Medplum Setup

To configure Okta as an external authentication provider, you will need 5 pieces of data:

- Authorize URL
- Token URL
- UserInfo URL
- Client ID
- Client Secret

Okta uses separate domains per organization. You will need your organization's Okta server. This is called the Okta "baseUrl". You can find it in the top-left menu of the Okta admin panel by clicking on your name when logged in.

![Okta Find URL](/img/auth/okta-find-url.png)

The "baseUrl" could look something like this `dev-71569655.okta.com` or could be a named subdomain like `mydomain.okta.com`. Once you have obtained it, construct the Authorize, Token and UserInfo URLs as follows:

- Authorize URL = ${baseUrl}/v1/authorize (e.g., "https://dev-71569655.okta.com/ oauth2/v1/authorize")
- Token URL = ${baseUrl}/oauth2/v1/token (e.g., "https://dev-71569655.okta.com/oauth2/v1/token")
- UserInfo URL = ${baseUrl}/oauth2/v1/userinfo (e.g., "https://dev-71569655.okta.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo")

Client ID and Client secret will be the same as those obtained at the end of the previous section.

:::caution Note

Configuring a DL-IDP on the Medplum Hosted service requires a Medplum team member, contact us at hello@medplum.com to enable. For those self-hosting, setup below requires super admin privileges.

:::

Create a [`DomainConfiguration`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/domainconfiguration) resource with the five elements above and save. Once the resource has been saved, all new authentication requests from that domain will use Okta authentication.
