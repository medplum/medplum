# Custom Welcome Emails

When a new project membership is created, either by "invite" or self "register", by default Medplum sends a "Welcome" email with account setup instructions for the configured "app" URL. For example, on Medplum's hosted environment, the email will include a link to "https://app.medplum.com/setpassword/...".

Medplum fully supports creating a white-label experience where users do not see any Medplum branding. That includes overriding all email behavior.

This document describes the steps to send custom Welcome email messages.

In short, here are the key steps:

1. Create a "Set Password" page in your application
1. Create a Medplum Bot that processes new `ProjectMembership` resources
1. Create a FHIR Subscription that connects `ProjectMembership` resources to the bot

## Set Password Page

In your custom application, you will need a "Set Password" page. This will be the page where users go to confirm their email address. For a full example of a "Set Password" page, check out the source to [`SetPasswordPage.tsx`](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/blob/main/packages/app/src/SetPasswordPage.tsx) for the Medplum App.

Key functions of the page:

- Receives `id` and `secret` from URL parameters
- Prompts the user for `password` and `confirmPassword`
- Verifies that `password` and `confirmPassword` match
- Sends the `id`, `secret`, and `password` to the `/auth/setpassword` API endpoint

## New Membership Bot

Create a Medplum Bot to handle new `ProjectMembership` resources. The bot will send a custom email message to the user.

:::tip

If you are new to Medplum Bots, you may want to read the [Bots](/docs/bots) documentation first.

:::

This Bot will use `ProjectMembership` and `PasswordChangeRequest` resources, so the Bot must be a "Project Admin" to access these resources.

Here is a full example of a Bot that sends a custom email message:

<MedplumCodeBlock language="ts" selectBlocks="customWelcomeEmails" showLineNumbers>
  {ExampleCode}
</MedplumCodeBlock>

Create, save, and deploy your bot. Make note of the Bot ID.

## FHIR Subscription

Create a FHIR Subscription that connects `ProjectMembership` resources to the bot. The subscription will trigger the bot when a new `ProjectMembership` resource is created.

Go to [Subscriptions](https://app.medplum.com/Subscription) and click "New...".

Enter the following values:

- Status = `active`
- Reason = `New membership`
- Criteria = `ProjectMembership`
- Channel Type = `rest-hook`
- Channel Endpoint = `Bot/YOUR_BOT_ID`

## Testing

To test your custom welcome email, create a new user account. The user will receive a custom email message.
