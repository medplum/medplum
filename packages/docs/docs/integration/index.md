# Integration

Complex integrations are built by composing [bots](/docs/bots/), [subscriptions](/docs/subscriptions/index.md), [authentication and authorization](/docs/auth/index.md) and the [Typescript SDK](/docs/sdk/).

This section will include common integration patterns and official Medplum supported integrations.
