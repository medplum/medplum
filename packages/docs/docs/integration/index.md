# Integration

Complex integrations are built by composing [bots](/docs/bots/), [subscriptions](/docs/subscriptions/index.md), [authentication and authorization](/docs/auth/index.md) and the [Typescript SDK](/docs/sdk/).

- [Integration Features and Fixes](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Aintegration) on Github show the code that powers many of the integrations.
- [Audit and Logging Features](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Aaudit-logging) show several security and observability integrations.
- [Bot Pull Requests](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/issues?q=label%3Abots) can be good reference material for how integrations work.
- [Auth Pull Requests](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Aauth) can also be good reference material for integration planning and learning.

This section will include common integration patterns and official Medplum supported integrations.
