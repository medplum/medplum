# Binary Data

Managing, storing, and retrieving binary files is a fundamental requirement in modern healthcare applications. Medplum, an open-source, API-first healthcare technology platform, provides a structured approach to this. This article dives into how to upload binary files to Medplum using the FHIR `Binary` resource type, detailing the process and Medplum's specific optimizations.

## Introduction to FHIR `Binary`

The FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard introduces the `Binary` resource type. It's designed to hold any kind of data in a binary form, encompassing but not limited to, images, PDFs, audio, and even video. This allows a standardized means to store and reference raw content, simplifying integration between healthcare systems.

## Creating a FHIR `Binary`

To upload binary files to Medplum, you'll first need to create a `Binary` resource.

### Using raw HTTP via `curl`

The HTTP API to upload a `Binary` is straightforward:

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" \
     --data-binary "@./yourfile.jpg" \
     https://api.medplum.com/fhir/R4/Binary
```

This is a short snippet, but each line has significant meaning.

First, the `Authorization` header is required to authenticate the request. See the [**Client Credentials tutorial**](/docs/auth/methods/client-credentials) guide for how to obtain an access token.

Next, the `Content-Type` header is required to specify the MIME type of the file being uploaded. You can always use the generic `application/octet-stream` type if you don't know the exact type, but beware that this may cause issues when consuming the `Binary` in an application. It is always recommended to use the correct MIME type if possible. See [Common MIME types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types).

To upload a file, use the `--data-binary` flag. The `--data-binary` flag is used to upload the raw binary data to avoid any encoding issues. Also note `curl`'s special syntax for referencing a file by file name using the "@" character.

### Using the Medplum SDK `MedplumClient`

Medplum provides a JavaScript/TypeScript SDK that makes it easy to upload binary files.

<MedplumCodeBlock language="ts" selectBlocks="createBinary">
  {ExampleCode}
</MedplumCodeBlock>

The return value is the newly created resource, including the ID and meta.

The `data` parameter can be `string | File | Blob | Uint8Array`.

A `File` object often comes from a `<input type="file">` element.

A `Blob` object often comes from a `fetch()` call.

A `Uint8Array` object often comes from a `FileReader` or `ArrayBuffer`.

Beware passing in a `string`! This will cause the string to be encoded as UTF-8, which may not be what you want. If you have base-64 encoded content, you must first decode it to one of the binary types first before passing it to `createBinary()`.

In addition to `medplum.createBinary()`, the Medplum SDK also provides `medplum.createAttachment()` which is similar but also creates an `Attachment` object. Note that `Attachment` is not a resource type, it is merely an in memory object to make it easier to work with binary data.

### Create `Binary` via external URL

For large files such as videos and images, it can be inconvenient to download contents to the client before uploading to Medplum. In these situations, you can create a [`Media`](../api/fhir/resources/media) resource with a `url` parameter pointing to the location of the content.

<BrowserOnlyTabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
    <MedplumCodeBlock language="ts" selectBlocks="mediaImport,externalUrl">
      {ExampleCode}
    </MedplumCodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```py

API_URL = 'https://api.medplum.com/fhir/R4'
MEDIA_URL = 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581385339821-5b358673a883'
media = {
  'resourceType': 'Media',
  'basedOn': [{
    'reference': 'ServiceRequest/12345'
  }],
  'status': 'completed',    # `status` is a required field
  'content': {
    'title': 'plums-python.jpg',
    'contentType': 'image/jpeg',
    'url': MEDIA_URL,
  }
};

requests.post(f'{API_URL}/Media', json=media, headers={
  'Authorization': f'Bearer {auth_token}'
})

```

  </TabItem>
</BrowserOnlyTabs>

See the [**Client Credentials tutorial**](/docs/auth/methods/client-credentials) guide for how to obtain an access token

## Referencing a `Binary` in an Attachment

Once uploaded, the `Binary` resource can be referenced in various FHIR resources.

**a. Patient Profile Picture - `Patient.photo`:**

<MedplumCodeBlock language="ts" selectBlocks="profilePhoto">
  {ExampleCode}
</MedplumCodeBlock>

**b. Message Attachment - `Communication.payload.contentAttachment`:**

<MedplumCodeBlock language="ts" selectBlocks="messageAttachment">
  {ExampleCode}
</MedplumCodeBlock>

:::caution Attachment Data
When creating an [`Attachment`](/docs/api/fhir/datatypes/attachment), we recommend that you _do not_ use the `data` field to provide the full binary data string. This can make the attachment very large and can cause issues when making HTTP requests. See the [Handling External Files guide](/docs/charting/external-documents#example-creating-a-documentreference-for-a-binary-file) for an example of how to upload and reference [`Binary`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/binary) resources.

## Consuming a FHIR `Binary` in an Application

In a normal FHIR server, when reading a FHIR resource that references a `Binary`, you'd receive a URL to the `Binary` resource.

For example:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "photo": [
    {
      "contentType": "image/jpeg",
      "url": "Binary/12345"
    }
  ]
}
```

And then you would be responsible for downloading the `Binary` resource.

Unfortunately, this poses of challenges:

1. Accessing content in a browser can be tricky. Elements like `<img>` or `<video>` can't easily set the `Authorization` header.
2. When dealing with massive files, especially videos, downloading the whole file isn't optimal. Instead, HTTP range requests, which fetch specific byte ranges, are preferred.

**Medplum's Solution: Presigned URLs:**

Medplum sidesteps these limitations by automatically rewriting FHIR Attachment URLs referencing `Binary` resources to short-lived presigned URLs.

Instead of a normal `Binary/{id}` URL, the Attachment URL will look like this:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "photo": [
    {
      "contentType": "image/jpeg",
      "url": "https://storage.medplum.com/12345?token=..."
    }
  ]
}
```

This powerful feature grants several benefits:

- **Short-lived Access:** These URLs expire after 60 minutes, ensuring data remains secure.
- **No Need for Authorization Header:** Presigned URLs inherently carry authorization, meaning no additional headers are required.
- **Compatibility with Media Tags:** Works seamlessly with HTML tags like `<img>` and `<video>`.
- **Supports Range Requests:** Perfect for streaming large media files.

Using this feature in the browser can potentially cause CORS issues. If you are displaying the [`Binary`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/binary) in `<a>` or `<object>` tags, you can use the URL as is.

However, if you want to allow users to download the [`Binary`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/binary) you will need to use the Medplum provided `download` helper function. This function takes a URL in the `Binary/{id}` format. This string is included in the presigned URL, so you will need to parse it to use the function.

<details>
  <summary>Example: Download a Binary</summary>
  <MedplumCodeBlock language="ts" selectBlocks="downloadBinary">
    {ExampleCode}
  </MedplumCodeBlock>
</details>

In essence, Medplum elevates the utility of the FHIR `Binary` resource type. By streamlining the upload and retrieval processes, Medplum provides developers with a straightforward, optimized, and user-friendly means to manage binary files in healthcare applications.

## Deep Dive on Storage URLs

Medplum's special treatment of `Attachment.url` and `Binary` references is powerful, but it can be confusing to understand how it works.

Here are some additional implementation details that may be helpful.

### Write Time

When you create or update a FHIR resource with an `Attachment` that references a `Binary`, Medplum will "normalize" the URL to `Binary/{id}` form.

Medplum server can detect and rewrite URLs in the following cases:

1. `Attachment.url` is a relative URL, e.g., `Binary/12345`
2. `Attachment.url` is a full URL, e.g., `https://api.medplum.com/fhir/R4/Binary/12345`
3. `Attachment.url` is a full URL, e.g., `https://storage.medplum.com/12345`

In all cases, Medplum will rewrite the URL to `Binary/{id}` form.

### Read Time

When you read a FHIR resource (read by ID, read history, or search) that references a `Binary`, Medplum will generate a unique presigned URL.

When using the Medplum cloud service, this feature is enabled by default.

When self-hosting, this feature requires configuring a signing key. The Medplum CDK construct includes this automatically.

## Proxy `Binary` content through Medplum server

While Medplum's default behavior of rewriting Attachment URLs to presigned URLs offers many benefits (as described above), there are scenarios where you might prefer to serve binary content directly through your Medplum server instance. This can be useful for:

- **Self-hosting environments** where direct access might be restricted or undesirable.
- **Simplified network configuration** by routing all traffic through a single endpoint.
- **Centralized logging and monitoring** on your Medplum server for binary data access.

Medplum provides a way to configure your server to act as a proxy for binary content, allowing all `Attachment.url` references to be served directly from your Medplum API endpoint.

#### How it Works

When configured for proxying, Medplum will continue to store your binary data in your chosen storage solution (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, local filesystem). However, instead of generating presigned URLs that point directly to the storage provider, it will generate URLs that point back to your Medplum server's `/storage/` endpoint. When a request comes to this endpoint, the Medplum server retrieves the binary content from your configured storage and proxies it back to the client.

#### Configuration Steps

To enable the Medplum server as a binary content proxy, you need to set two key configuration properties in your Medplum server's configuration:

1.  **`binaryStorage`**: This setting specifies your underlying storage solution. This is where the binary files will actually be stored.

    - **Examples:** `file:./binary/`, `s3:your-bucket-name`, `azure:your-container-name`, `gs:your-bucket-name`

2.  **`storageBaseUrl`**: This setting tells Medplum the base URL for serving binary content. For server proxying, this should be your Medplum `baseUrl` followed by `/storage/`.

    - **Example:**
      If your `baseUrl` is `https://api.example.com/`, then `storageBaseUrl` should be `https://api.example.com/storage/`.

Here's an example of how these settings might appear in your Medplum server configuration (e.g., `medplum.config.json`):

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "https://api.example.com/",
  "binaryStorage": "s3:my-medplum-binary-bucket",
  "storageBaseUrl": "https://api.example.com/storage/"
  // ... other configuration settings
}
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **Performance:** Proxying binary data through your Medplum server adds an extra hop and processing overhead compared to direct access via presigned URLs. For very high-traffic applications or extremely large files, consider the performance implications.
- **Scalability:** Ensure your Medplum server infrastructure (e.g., CPU, memory, network bandwidth) is adequately scaled to handle the increased load if you are proxying a large volume of binary data.
- **CORS:** When proxying, your `storageBaseUrl` will be on the same origin as your Medplum API. This can simplify CORS configurations for clients compared to accessing external storage domains.
- **Security:** While proxying can centralize access control, ensure your Medplum server is properly secured and hardened, as it will now be directly exposed for serving binary content.

By configuring `binaryStorage` and `storageBaseUrl` appropriately, you gain more control over how your binary content is served, tailoring Medplum to your specific deployment and operational requirements.
