# FHIR Batch Requests

FHIR allows users to create batch requests to bundle multiple API calls into a single HTTP request. Batch requests can improve speed and efficiency and can reduce HTTP traffic when working with many resources.

:::tip Cloning a project
If you want to create a copy of a project, say for a new environment, this can be done using the `$clone` operation rather than by creating a batch request. For more details [see the Projects guide](/docs/access/projects#cloning-and-expunging-projects).

## How to Perform a Batch Request

Batch requests are modeled using the `Bundle` resource by setting `Bundle.type` to `"batch"`.

Batch requests are performed by sending a POST request to `[baseURL]/` with a FHIR Bundle. The Medplum SDK provides the `executeBatch` helper function to simplify this operation.

The details of your request will be in the `entry` field of the `Bundle`, which is an array of `BundleEntry` objects. Each `BundleEntry` should have the details of the resource you are working with, as well as additional information about the request you are making.

| Element               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `request.url`         | The URL to send your request to. This is relative to the base R4 FHIR URL (e.g. https://api.medplum.com/fhir/R4).                                                                                                                 |
| `request.method`      | The type of HTTP request you are making. Can be one of the following: <ul><li>GET: Read a resource or perform a search</li><li>POST: Create a resource</li><li>PUT: Update a resource</li><li>DELETE: Delete a resource</li></ul> |
| `request.ifNoneExist` | [See below](#conditional-batch-actions)                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `resource`            | The details of the FHIR resource that is being created/updated.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `fullUrl`             | [See below](#internal-references)                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

:::danger Batch vs Transaction
Medplum does not currently distinguish between `'batch'` and `'transaction'` type [`Bundle`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/bundle) resources and does not provide atomic transactions. This is currently being worked on, and you can track progress on the issue [here](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/issues/1369).
:::

## References in Bundles

When using batch requests, it is common to require resources to refer to one another: either between two resources within the Bundle, or to resources outside the Bundle. FHIR provides ways to automatically link the resources together, without needing to know the exact resource IDs up front.

### Internal References

Resources within the same Bundle often need to link to one another: for example, you may create a `Patient` resource that is the `subject` of an `Encounter` created in the same batch request.

Creating internal references is done by assigning temporary IDs to each bundle entry. The `fullUrl` field is set to `'urn:uuid:'` followed by a temporary UUID.

Other bundle entries can refer to this resource using the temporary `urn:uuid:` string, which is replaced by the real reference during batch processing.

<details>
  <summary>Example: Create a patient and encounter whose subject is the created patient</summary>
  <MedplumCodeBlock language="ts" selectBlocks="internalReference">
    {ExampleCode}
  </MedplumCodeBlock>
</details>

### External \(Conditional) References

Additionally, it may be necessary to link to resources that already exist on the server outside of the Bundle, for which the ID of the
target resource is not known. To handle this use case, FHIR allows populating the reference with a search query string,
which will be resolved by Medplum server at resource creation time. This search must resolve to a single resource, otherwise
an error will be returned. For example:

<details>
  <summary>Example: Create multiple patients that link to the same provider</summary>
  <MedplumCodeBlock language="ts" selectBlocks="externalReference">
    {ExampleCode}
  </MedplumCodeBlock>
</details>

## Conditional Batch Actions

There may be situations where you would only like to create a a resource as part of a batch request if it does not already exist.

You can conditionally perform batch actions by adding the `ifNoneExist` property to the `request` element of your `Bundle`.

The `ifNoneExist` property uses [search parameters](/docs/search/basic-search#search-parameters) to search existing resources and only performs the action if no match is found. Since you are already defining the `url` to send the request to, you only need to enter the actual parameter in this field (i.e., everything that would come after the `?` when submitting an actual search).

<details>
  <summary>Example: Create a patient and organization, only if the organization does not already exist</summary>
  <MedplumCodeBlock language="ts" selectBlocks="conditionalCreate">
    {ExampleCode}
  </MedplumCodeBlock>
</details>

## Performing Upserts

Previously, performing an "upsert" (i.e. either creating or updating a resource based on whether it already exists)
required using a batch operation. This functionality is now implemented directly as a [conditional update](/docs/fhir-datastore/create-fhir-data#upsert)
to provide strong transactional guarantees around the operation in a single, simple `PUT` request.

## PATCH actions in a Batch

Because the request body of a PATCH request is an array of [JSON Patch](https://jsonpatch.com/) operations, not a resource,
some extra conversion is required to represent these actions in a batch request. The [FHIR recommended pattern](http://hl7.org/fhir/R5/http.html#jsonpatch-transaction)
for this use case is to [base64 encode](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4) the JSON Patch array
and represent it as a [Binary](/docs/api/fhir/resources/binary) resource:

```js
{
  "request": {
    "method": "PATCH",
    "url": "Patient/6ffaaab4-ff7e-4416-80c7-8fce95c3e31c"
  },
  "resource": "resource": {
    "resourceType": "Binary",
    "contentType": "application/json-patch+json",
    // Encoded: [{"op":"test","path":"/active","value":false}]
    "data": "W3sib3AiOiJyZXBsYWNlIiwicGF0aCI6Ii9hY3RpdmUiLCJ2YWx1ZSI6ZmFsc2V9XQo="
  },
}
```

Additionally, Medplum supports passing JSON Patch formatted as a [Parameters](/docs/api/fhir/resources/parameters)
resource, making it easier to see what operations are happening in the batch.

:::note Value Formatting

To avoid parsing ambiguity and simplify the format of the `Parameters`, all values are passed as
JSON strings, via the `valueString` field on each corresponding `Parameter.parameter.part` with `"name": "value"`.

All types of values, including booleans, strings, objects, and arrays, should be passed to `JSON.stringify()`
or equivalent rather than being included directly in the `Parameters`.

:::

```js
{
  "request": {
    "method": "PATCH",
    "url": "Patient/6ffaaab4-ff7e-4416-80c7-8fce95c3e31c"
  },
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "Parameters",
    "parameter": [
      {
        "name": "operation",
        "part": [
          { "name": "op", "valueCode": "test" },
          { "name": "path", "valueString": "/active" },
          { "name": "value", "valueString": "false" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "operation",
        "part": [
          { "name": "op", "valueCode": "add" },
          { "name": "path", "valueString": "/name/-" },
          // Note that values must be JSON encoded
          { "name": "value", "valueString": "{\"given\":[\"Dave\"],\"family\":\"Smith\"}" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Medplum Autobatching

The Medplum Client provides the option to automatically batch FHIR `read` and `search` requests using the `autoBatchTime` parameter. This field allows you to set a time window during which to batch up any `GET` requests. After this window expires, the `MedplumClient` will add them to a `Bundle` behind the scenes and then execute them as a batch request.

Autobatching works by creating a queue of `Promises` issued within the `autoBatchTime` window and then creating a bundle out of these requests. To allow the queue to be created, you must make sure that the main thread continues to run, so you should not use `await` after each request. Using `await` will pause the main thread each time a request is made, so a queue cannot be created.

Instead you should create the queue of `Promise` requests and then use `Promise.all()` to resolve all of them at once.
