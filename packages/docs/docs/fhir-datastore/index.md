# FHIR Datastore

The Medplum FHIR Datastore supports all CRUD operations (creating, reading/searching, updating, and deleting) on FHIR resources. In addition it supports a large set of additional operations that can be used to validate and model data, execute bots, and more. If you are not familiar with FHIR, see the [FHIR Basics docs](/docs/fhir-basics.md).

Much of Medplum's documentation makes reference to the datastore in some way. This section will guide you through common operations help provide context on how the datastore interacts with other features, including:

- [Authentication and Authorization](/docs/auth/index.md)
- [Bots](/docs/bots/index.md)
- [Subscriptions](/docs/subscriptions/index.md)
- [Analytics](/docs/analytics/index.md)
- [Search](/docs/search/index.md)
- [React Components](/docs/react)
