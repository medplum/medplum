# FHIR Datastore

The Medplum FHIR Datastore supports creating, updating, searching, and deleting resources. It also supports a large set of FHIR operations.

Much of the documentation will make reference to the datastore in some way. This section will guide you through common operations on the datastore and help provide context on how the datastore interacts with other features such as [authentication and authorization](/docs/auth/index.md), [bots](/docs/bots/index.md), [subscriptions](/docs/subscriptions/index.md), [analytics](/docs/analytics/index.md), [search](/docs/search/index.md), [React components](/docs/react) and more.
