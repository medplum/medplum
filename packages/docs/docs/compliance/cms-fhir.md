# CMS FHIR Certification

CMS FHIR Certification is for payors who want to fulfill CMS requirements, particularly the requirements of [CMS 9115](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cms-9115-f.pdf). At a high level, the process entails implementing several [FHIR Implementation Guides](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/implementationguide.html) (IG). An Implementation Guide is a set of rules that defines how to use FHIR resources to solve a particular problem or implement a particular data flow.

Once the IG is in place, you'll need to test against [Touchstone Aegis](https://touchstone.aegis.net/touchstone/userguide/html/index.html) test suite to confirm conformance. Depending on your program requirements, you may or may not choose to certify. CMS requires and recommends new IGs each year as regulations change and systems mature. Designing a system that can continually upgrade and adapt to new IG requirements will help streamline operations.

In general, organizations can expect that new FHIR functionality, especially for organization to organization data flow will be a theme of the coming mandates. This includes payor-to-payor interfacing as well as payor-provider FHIR interfacing.

Medplum can be used to implement the FHIR IGs in a quick and cost-effective manner. At a high level the workflow process is as follows:

1. Configure your Medplum project to capture well-formed FHIR data
2. Use existing tooling such as `Strict Mode`, [Bots](/docs/bots), [External Auth](/docs/auth/methods/external-identity-providers) and more to ensure data correctness
3. Test against the relevant Touchstone FHIR IG suite
4. Certify and receive badges as needed

The following are common IGs relevant for payors:

## Future Implementation Guides

At present more implementation guides are being discussed, developed and balloted, and the Federal regulations related to this field are under constant revision. The [DaVinci Project](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/DVP) confluence is a good resource for monitoring proposed IGs, and assessing their adoption and maturity.
