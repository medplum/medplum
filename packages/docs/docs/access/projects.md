# Projects

Medplum [`Projects`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/project) are the primary mechanism of access control. [`Projects`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/project) are isolated containers of FHIR resources that are administered separately, and which can have different settings.

Medplum [`Projects`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/project) enable the following use cases:

- **Development vs. Production:** A common requirement for development teams to have a separate [`Project`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/project) , with non-protected data, for testing and debugging, before deploying workflow changes to production. A common Medplum usage pattern is to create a "development", "staging", and "production" [`Project`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/project).

- **Multi-tenancy:** In [B2B2C environments](https://a16z.com/b2c2b-in-digital-health-a-founders-playbook/), a service provider may partner with multiple healthcare organizations to deliver care to patients. [`Projects`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/project) can provide each of these partners their own isolated environments, that have their own patient data, log-in flows, and project administrators. Medplum uses a multi-tenant instance for our [hosted offering](/pricing).

## Isolation Model

Medplum [`Projects`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/project) create a hard boundary between FHIR resources, and resources within one project cannot reference resources in another.

Additionally, [`Projects`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/project) each have their own user administration. A user can be a member of one, or multiple [`Projects`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/project), with different privileges in each. See our [User Administration Guide](/docs/auth/user-management-guide) for more information.

[`Projects`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/project) can each be configured with own global settings and secrets (see [Project Settings](#settings) below).

:::tip Server Shared resources

For performance and convenience, the Medplum server provides some system level, read-only resources that are shared between projects. Examples include [`StructureDefinitions`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/structuredefinition) and [`ValueSets`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/valueset).

While they _do_ cross the [`Project`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/project) isolation boundary, most application developers will not have to interact these resources.

:::

## The SuperAdmin `Project` {#superadmin}

The main exception to this isolation model is the "Super Admin" project. This is a special project that provides a global view over all the resources on the Medplum server. See our [SuperAdmin Guide](/docs/self-hosting/super-admin-guide) for more information.

The SuperAdmin has the following privileges:

- Access to protected resources.
- Ability to overwrite the `id` of a resource, which is normally server generated.
- Ability to overwrite fields in the `meta` element of resources such as `author`, `lastUpdated`, etc.

:::warning

Logging into the Super Admin project allows for potential dangerous operations and is only intended for server administrators

## Project Secrets

Each [`Project`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/project) can store a set of key/value pairs to store configuration values, such as API keys, needed by Bots.

See [Bot Secrets](/docs/bots/bot-secrets) for more information.

## Cloning and Expunging `Projects`

Self-hosted users have two advanced project administration operations available to them:

- `$clone` - Make a copy of an existing [`Project`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/project) and all its resources.
- `$expunge` - Perform a "hard delete" of [`Project`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/project) and all its resources. This will remove all the related resource rows from the database.

For more information, refer to the Super Admin [Project Management guide](/docs/self-hosting/super-admin-cli#project-management)
