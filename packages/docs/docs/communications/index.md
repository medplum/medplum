# Messaging & Communications

FHIR supports messaging workflows through the [Communication](/docs/api/fhir/resources/communication)  resource. This resource allows your system to manage message content and metadata in a format independent of its medium (email, sms, chat,etc.).

These [Communications](/docs/api/fhir/resources/communication) can also be structured to support a variety of use cases, including:
 - [Threaded messages](/docs/communications/organizing-communications)
 - [Asynchronous encounters](/docs/communications/async-encounters)
 -  Omni-channel messaging
 -  Real-time notifications using Websockets


Check out our [Contact Center Demo](https://github.com/medplum/medplum-chat-demo) for an in-depth example of a provider messaging app.
