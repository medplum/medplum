# Overview

Medplum is based on the [FHIR API](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/).

Medplum is "FHIR Native," using version 4.0.1 (aka R4), meaning the service stores data in the actual FHIR format, documented [here](https://www.medplum.com/docs/api/fhir/resources). 

Medplum also implements [custom resource types](https://www.medplum.com/docs/api/fhir/medplum) to handle user management, authentication, and authorization. 

The base URL for hosted Medplum is https://api.medplum.com/fhir/R4
