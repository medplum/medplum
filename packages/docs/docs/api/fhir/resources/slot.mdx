  <TabItem value="usage" label="Usage">
<div> <a name="scope"></a> <p> <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/slot">Slot</Link> resources are used to provide time-slots that can be booked using an appointment. They do not provide any information about appointments that are available, just the time, and optionally what the time can be used for. These are effectively spaces of free/busy time.<br/>       <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/slot">Slots</Link> can also be marked as busy without having appointments associated.     </p> <p> A slot can have more than one appointment allocated to it. A scheduling system may permit multiple allocations up to a specific number of places. An example of this type of usage        could be where the slot is being used for a group service that permits 5 participants at        the same time. </p> <p> A slot can be marked as over-booked indicating that there are too many appointments allocated to it. </p> <p> In some situations a service may have a specific set of slots reserved for specific uses, such  as "walk-ins" or a specific organization has a "standing booking" for Thursday mornings. These should be represented using the appointmentType field with a specified and agreed value.<br/> Security Permissions or specific business rules on the system could enforce that only eligible appointments are allocated to them. </p>     <p>       If a service had a weekly schedule created that permitted eight 1 hour appointments each       day of a working week (Monday - Friday), this would be constructed by a single <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/schedule">Schedule</Link>       resource with the dates for the start and end of the week set, and then 40 (5x8) <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/slot">Slot</Link>        resources associated with it.<br/>       As appointments fill up the schedule, these slots would individually be marked as busy       as the appointments are filled into the slots.<br/>       The slots in a schedule do not need to be the same size, and can be different for different       days of the week.<br/>   </p><p>       <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/slot">Slot</Link> instances do not have any recurrence information included. If recurring information is       desired, this will be managed outside these resources, or included as extensions.   </p>   <p>       Note that booking an appointment does not necessarily require that slot resources be identified.   When attempting to book an appointment, if the requestor knows ahead of time which schedulable     resources are required, then identifying individual slots from the resources' schedules prior to creating   the appointment is appropriate.   However, in some medical scheduling scenarios, determining which resources are required for an appointment   is very complex, and options other than using schedule+slot may be a better solution.        </p>     <p></p>   </div>
