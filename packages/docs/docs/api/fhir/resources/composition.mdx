# Composition

A set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a single logical package that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to who is making the statement. A <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> defines the structure and narrative content necessary for a document. However, a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> alone does not constitute a document. Rather, the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> must be the first entry in a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/bundle">Bundle</a> where <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/bundle">Bundle</a>.type=document, and any other resources referenced from <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> must be included as subsequent entries in the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/bundle">Bundle</a> (for example <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient">Patient</a>, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/practitioner">Practitioner</a>, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/encounter">Encounter</a>, etc.).

    <div> <a name="scope"></a>  <p>  A <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> is the basic structure from which <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/documents.html">FHIR Documents</a> -  immutable bundles with attested narrative - are built. A single logical composition may be  associated with a series of derived documents, each of which is a frozen copy of the  composition. </p>  <p> Note: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EN_13606">EN 13606 </a> uses the term "Composition"  to refer to a single commit to an EHR system, and offers some common examples: a composition  containing a consultation note, a progress note, a report or a letter, an investigation report,  a prescription form or a set of bedside nursing observations. Using <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> for an attested EHR commit is a valid use of the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> resource, but for FHIR purposes, it would be usual to make more granular updates with individual provenance statements. </p>  <p> The <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/composition-clinicaldocument.html">Clinical Document profile</a> constrains <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> to specify a clinical document (matching <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7">CDA </a>).   See also the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/comparison-cda.html">comparison with CDA</a>. </p> </div>

    <div> <a name="bnr"></a>  <p> <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> is a structure for grouping information for purposes of persistence and attestability.  There are several other grouping structures in FHIR with distinct purposes: </p> <ul> <li> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> resource - enumerates a flat collection of resources and provides features for managing the collection.   While a particular <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> instance may represent a "snapshot", from a business process perspective, the notion of "list"  is dynamic â€“ items are added and removed over time.  The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> resource references other resources.  <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">Lists</a> may be  curated and have specific business meaning. </li> <li> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/group">Group</a> resource - defines a group of specific people, animals, devices, etc. by enumerating them,  or by describing qualities that group members have. The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/group">Group</a> resource refers to other resources, possibly implicitly.   <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/group">Groups</a> are intended to be acted upon or observed as a whole (e.g., performing therapy on a group, calculating risk for a group,  etc.).  This resource will commonly be used for public health (e.g., describing an at-risk population), clinical trials (e.g.,  defining a test subject pool) and similar purposes. </li> <li> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/bundle">Bundle</a> resource - is an infrastructure container for a group of resources.  It does not have narrative  and is used to group collections of resources for transmission, persistence or processing (e.g., messages, documents, transactions,  query responses, etc.).  The content of bundles is typically algorithmically determined for a particular exchange or persistence purpose. </li> <li> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> resource - defines a set of healthcare-related information that is assembled  together into a single logical document that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, establishes its own context and  that has clinical attestation with regard to who is making the statement. The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> resource provides the basic structure  of a FHIR <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/documents.html">document</a>.  The full content of the document is expressed using a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/bundle">Bundle</a>  containing the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> and its entries.  </li> </ul> <p> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> resource organizes clinical and administrative content into sections, each of which contains a narrative,  and references other resources for supporting data. The narrative content of the various sections in a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> are  supported by the resources referenced in the section entries.  The complete set of content to make up a document includes  the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> resource together with various resources pointed to or indirectly connected to the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a>, all gathered together into a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/bundle">Bundle</a> for transport and persistence. Resources associated with the following list of <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> references SHALL be included in the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/bundle">Bundle</a>: </p> <ul>  <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/composition-definitions.html#Composition.subject">Composition.subject</a></li>  <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/composition-definitions.html#Composition.encounter">Composition.encounter</a></li>  <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/composition-definitions.html#Composition.author">Composition.author</a></li>  <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/composition-definitions.html#Composition.attester.party">Composition.attester.party</a></li>  <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/composition-definitions.html#Composition.custodian">Composition.custodian</a></li>  <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/composition-definitions.html#Composition.event.detail">Composition.event.detail</a></li>  <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/composition-definitions.html#Composition.section.author">Composition.section.author</a></li>  <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/composition-definitions.html#Composition.section.focus">Composition.section.focus</a></li>  <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/composition-definitions.html#Composition.section.entry">Composition.section.entry</a></li> </ul>   <p> Other resources referred to by those resources MAY be included in the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/bundle">Bundle</a> at the discretion of the authoring  system as documented in the system's operation definition (such as <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/composition-operation-document.html">$document</a> operation),  or as specified by any applicable profiles.  </p> </div>

    <div> <a name="bnc"></a>  <a name="status"></a> <h3 class="self-link-parent"> <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> Status Codes <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition" title="link to here" class="self-link"></a></h3> <p> Every composition has a status element, which describes the status of the content of the composition, taken from this list of codes: </p> <h3 class="self-link-parent"> The workflow/clinical status of the composition. <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/composition.html#2.41.3.2" title="link to here" class="self-link"></a></h3> <table class="codes">  <tbody><tr><td>preliminary</td><td>This is a preliminary composition or document (also known as initial or interim). The content may be incomplete or unverified.</td></tr>  <tr><td>final</td><td>This version of the composition is complete and verified by an appropriate person and no further work is planned. Any subsequent updates would be on a new version of the composition.</td></tr>  <tr><td>amended</td><td>The composition content or the referenced resources have been modified (edited or added to) subsequent to being released as "final" and the composition is complete and verified by an authorized person.</td></tr>  <tr><td>entered-in-error</td><td>The composition or document was originally created/issued in error, and this is an amendment that marks that the entire series should not be considered as valid.</td></tr> </tbody></table>   <p> <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> status generally only moves down through this list - it moves from <code>preliminary</code> to <code>final</code> and then it may progress to <code>amended</code>.  Note that in many workflows, only <code>final</code> compositions are made available and the <code>preliminary</code> status is not used.  </p> <p> A very few compositions are created entirely in error in the workflow - usually the composition concerns the wrong patient or is written by the wrong author, and the error is only detected after the composition has been used or documents have been derived from it. To support resolution of this case,  the composition is updated to be marked as <code>entered-in-error</code> and a new derived document can be created. This means that the entire series of derived  documents is now considered to be created in error and systems receiving derived documents based on retracted compositions SHOULD remove data taken from earlier documents from routine use and/or take other appropriate actions. Systems are not required to  provide this workflow or support documents derived from retracted compositions, but they SHALL NOT ignore a status of <code>entered-in-error</code>.  Note that systems that handle compositions or derived documents and don't support the error status need to define  some other way of handling compositions that are created in error; while this is not a common occurrence, some clinical systems  have no provision for removing erroneous information from a patient's record, and there is no way for a user to know that it is not fit for use - this is not safe.  </p>  <a name="cda"></a> <h3 class="self-link-parent"> Note for CDA aware readers <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition" title="link to here" class="self-link"></a></h3>  <p> Many users of this specification are familiar with the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7">Clinical Document Architecture </a> (CDA) and related specifications. CDA is a primary design input to the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> resource (other principal inputs are other HL7 document specifications and EN13606). There are three important structural  differences between CDA and the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> resource: </p> <ul>  <li>A composition is a logical construct- its identifier matches to the CDA ClinicalDocument.setId.   <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> resources are wrapped into <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/documents.html">Document</a> structures, for exchange  of the whole package (the composition and its parts), and this wrapped, sealed entity is equivalent to a CDA document,   where the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/bundle">Bundle</a>.id is equivalent in function to ClinicalDocument.id (but it is not identical when interconverting, since it's a transform between them).</li>  <li>The composition section defines a section (or sub-section) of the document, but unlike CDA, the section entries are     actually references to other <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html">resources</a> that hold the supporting data content for the section.     This design means that the data can be reused in many other ways.     </li>   <li>Unlike CDA, the context defined in the <code>Composition</code> (the confidentiality, subject, author, event, event period and encounter) apply to the composition and do not specifically apply to the resources referenced from    the <code>section.entry</code>. There is no context flow model in FHIR, so each resource referenced from    within a <code>Composition</code> expresses its own individual context.  In this way, clinical content can    safely be extracted from the composition.</li> </ul> <p> In addition, note that both the code lists (e.g., <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-composition-status.html">Composition.status</a>) and the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> resource are <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/composition-mappings.html">mapped</a> to <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=186">HL7 v3 </a> and/or CDA. </p> </div>
