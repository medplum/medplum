# PlanDefinition

This resource allows for the definition of various types of plans as a sharable, consumable, and executable artifact. The resource is general enough to support the description of a broad range of clinical artifacts such as clinical decision support rules, order sets and protocols.

    <div> <a name="bnc"></a>  <p><strong>This resource is a <em>definition</em> resource from a FHIR workflow perspective</strong> - see <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html">Workflow</a>, specifically <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html#definition">Definition</a>.</p>  <p>A plan definition is a pre-defined group of actions to be taken in particular circumstances, often including conditional elements, options, and other decision points. The resource is flexible enough to be used to represent a variety of workflows, as well as clinical decision support and quality improvement assets, including order sets, protocols, and decision support rules.</p>  <p>PlanDefinitions can contain hierarchical groups of action definitions, where each action definition describes an activity to be performed (often in terms of an <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/activitydefinition">ActivityDefinition</a> resource), and each group defines additional behavior, relationships, and applicable conditions between the actions in the overall definition.</p>  <p>In addition to describing what should take place, each action in a plan definition can specify <i>when</i> and <i>whether</i> the action should take place. For when the action should be taken, the <code>trigger</code> element specifies the action should be taken in response to some trigger occurring (such as a particular point in a workflow being reached, or as the result of a prescription being ordered). For whether the action should be taken, the <code>condition</code> element can be used to provide an expression that evaluates to true or false to indicate the applicability of the action to the specific context.</p>  <p>The process of applying a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/plandefinition">PlanDefinition</a> to a particular context typically produces request resources representing the actions that should be performed, typically grouped within a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/careplan">CarePlan</a> and/or <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/requestgroup">RequestGroup</a> to capture relationships between the resulting request resources.</p>  <p>Each <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/activitydefinition">ActivityDefinition</a> is used to construct a specific resource, based on the definition of the activity and combined with contextual information for the particular patient that the plan definition is being applied to.</p>  <p>As with the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/activitydefinition">ActivityDefinition</a>, a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/plandefinition">PlanDefinition</a> may provide information about how to transform the activity to a specific intent resource, either by specifying a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/structuremap">StructureMap</a> that can be used to perform the transformation completely, or by specifying values for specific elements of the resulting resource using <code>dynamicValue</code> elements in the action.</p>  <p>Note that these mechanisms are provided on both the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/activitydefinition">ActivityDefinition</a> and the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/plandefinition">PlanDefinition</a> to allow both reusable transformation descriptions, as well as customization of those descriptions within specific contexts. As such, the transform descriptions specified on the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/plandefinition">PlanDefinition</a> <i>override</i> transform descriptions defined on the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/activitydefinition">ActivityDefinition</a>.</p>  <p>Dynamic values within the definitions can be provided by specifying the expression directly, or by referencing an expression defined within a library. For more information on how to reference expressions within resources, refer to the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/clinicalreasoning-topics-using-expressions.html">Using <a href="/docs/api/fhir/datatypes/expression">Expressions</a></a> topic.</p>  <p>As an example, the Low Suicide Risk example order set from the Clinical Decision Support Knowledge Artifact Specification can be represented using the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/plandefinition">PlanDefinition</a> and <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/activitydefinition">ActivityDefinition</a> structures: <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/plandefinition-example.html">Low Suicide Risk Example Order Set</a>.</p>  <p>In addition to the representation of <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/plandefinition">PlanDefinitions</a>, the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/plandefinition-operation-apply.html">$apply</a> operation allows <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/plandefinition">PlanDefinitions</a> to be applied to a specific context such as a patient, practitioner, or institution. For Order Sets specifically, this operation is expected to place the orders defined by the order set, consistent with the service functional requirements defined by the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=287">Order Set specification </a>.</p>  </div>

    <div>  <p>The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/plandefinition">PlanDefinition</a> resource is used to describe series, sequences, or groups of actions to be taken, while the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/activitydefinition">ActivityDefinition</a> resource is used to define each specific step or activity to be performed.</p>  <p>As the name implies, the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/plandefinition">PlanDefinition</a> resource is strictly definitional. It does not represent the intention to take any action, nor does it represent that any actions have been taken. Rather, the resource provides a definition that can be applied in the appropriate circumstances. When the plan definition is applied, the result will in general be a set of actions that should be (or potentially even have been) performed.</p>  <p>Note that the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/plandefinition">PlanDefinition</a> still has action-level information, as well as a reference to an <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/activitydefinition">ActivityDefinition</a>. The action-level information defined in the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/plandefinition">PlanDefinition</a> itself is used to describe how the actions are related to each other within the plan, where the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/activitydefinition">ActivityDefinition</a> contains only information about the activity itself. In addition, there is some overlapping information that allows the resources to be used independently, or in combination. See the Applying a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/plandefinition">PlanDefinition</a> section for more information.</p>  </div>
