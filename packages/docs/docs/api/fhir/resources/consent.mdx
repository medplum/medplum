    <div> <a name="scope"></a>  <p> The purpose of this Resource is to be used to express a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> regarding Healthcare. There are four  anticipated uses for the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Resource, all of which are written or verbal agreements by a  healthcare consumer [grantor] or a personal representative, made to an authorized entity [grantee]  concerning authorized or restricted actions with any limitations on purpose of use, and  handling instructions to which the authorized entity must comply:  </p> <ul>  <li>Privacy <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive: Agreement to collect, access, use or disclose (share) information.</li>  <li>Medical Treatment <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive: <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> to undergo a specific treatment (or record of refusal to consent).</li>  <li>Research <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive: <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> to participate in research protocol and information sharing required.</li>  <li>Advance Care Directives: <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> to instructions for potentially needed medical treatment (e.g. DNR).</li> </ul> <p> This resource is scoped to cover all four uses, but at this time, only the privacy use case is modeled.   The scope of the resource may change when the other possible scopes are investigated, tested, or profiled. </p> <p> A FHIR <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive instance is considered the encoded legally binding <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive if it meets  requirements of a policy domain requirements for an enforceable contract.   In some domains, electronic  signatures of one or both of the parties to the content of an encoded representation of a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Form  is deemed to constitute a legally binding <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive.  Some domains accept a notary’s electronic  signature over the wet or electronic signature of a party to the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive as the additional  identity proofing required to make an encoded <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive legally binding.  Other domains may  only accept a wet signature or might not require the parties’ signatures at all. </p> <p> Whatever the criteria are for making an encoded FHIR <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive legally binding, anything less  than a legally binding representation of a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive must be identified as such, i.e., as a  derivative of the legally binding <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive, which has specific usage in <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive workflow management. </p> <p><b>Definitions:</b></p> <table class="grid">  <tbody><tr><td>Consent</td><td>The record of a healthcare consumer’s policy choices, which permits or denies identified recipient(s) or recipient role(s) to perform one or more actions within a given policy context, for specific purposes and periods of time</td></tr>  <tr><td>Consent Directive</td><td>The legal record of a healthcare consumer's agreement with a party responsible for enforcing the consumer’s choices, which permits or denies identified actors or roles to perform actions affecting the consumer within a given context for specific purposes and periods of time</td></tr>  <tr><td>Consent Form</td><td>Human readable consent content describing one or more actions impacting the grantor for which the grantee would be authorized or prohibited from performing.

There are several Query/Response patterns that are typically used for obtaining information about consent directive content for the following use cases: <ul> <li>Find Active <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive:  A query that includes sufficient consent directive content to determine whether a specific party is authorized to share information governed by a consent directive with another specific party.  The Response is either: <ul> <li>“Yes” meaning that both parties are authorized to share the information with one another.</li> <li>“No” meaning that the authorized querier is not permitted to share with another specific party</li> <li>“No information found” meaning that there is no active <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive in which the querier is authorized to share the governed information.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Find <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive Authorized Entities: A query that includes sufficient consent directive content to return a list of entities with which the querier is authorized to share governed information.  The response to an authorized querier is the list of any authorized entities with which the querier is permitted to share governed information.  The response to an unauthorized querier is that “no information is found”.</li> <li>Find <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive(s): A query that includes sufficient consent directive content to return a list of <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive metadata for an authorized querier to determine what <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directives are available, and to locate and retrieve one or more of those <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directives as needed.</li> </ul> </td></tr>  <tr><td>Policy context</td><td>Any organizational or jurisdictional policies, which may limit the consumer’s policy choices, and which includes the named range of actions allowed</td></tr>  <tr><td>Healthcare Consumer</td><td>The individual establishing his/her personal consent (i.e. Consenter).

A Privacy <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a>  Directive as a legal record of a patient's (e.g. a healthcare consumer)  agreement with a party responsible for enforcing the patient's choices,  which permits or denies identified actors or roles to perform actions  affecting the patient within a given context for specific purposes and  periods of time. All consent directives have a policy context, which is any set of organizational or jurisdictional policies which may limit the  consumer’s policy choices, and which include a named range of actions allowed. In addition, Privacy <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directives provide the ability for a healthcare consumer  to delegate authority to a Substitute Decision Maker who may act on behalf of that individual. Alternatively, a consumer may author/publish their privacy preferences as a self-declared Privacy <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive.   </p> <p> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> resource on FHIR provides support for alternative representations for expressing  interoperable health information privacy consent directives in a standard form for the  exchange and enforcement by sending, intermediating, or receiving systems of privacy policies  that can be enforced by consuming systems (e.g., scanned documents, of computable structured  entries elements, FHIR structures with optional attached, or referenced unstructured representations.)  It may be used to represent the Privacy <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive itself, a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Statement, which  electronically represents a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive, or <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Metadata, which is the minimum  necessary consent content derived from a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directive for use in workflow management. </p> </div>

    <div> <a name="bnr"></a>   <p> <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> management - particularly privacy consent - is complicated by the fact that consent to share  is often itself necessary to protect. The need to protect the privacy of the privacy statement itself competes with the execution of the consent statement. For this reason, it is common to deal with  'consent statements' that are only partial representations of the full consent statement that the  patient provided.  </p> <p> For this reason, the consent resource contains two elements that refer back to the source: a master identifier, and a direct reference to content from which this <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Statement was derived. That reference can be one of several things: </p> <ul>  <li>A reference to another consent resource from which this limited statement was derived</li>  <li>A reference to a document format for the original source (e.g. PDF or CDA - see the   <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=280">HL7 CDAR2 ConsentDirective Implementation Guide </a>,   which incorporated the <a href="http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=Basic_Patient_Privacy_Consents">IHE <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/basic">Basic</a> <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient">Patient</a> Privacy <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consents</a> (BPPC) </a> ), either directly, or in a reference</li>  <li>The source can be included in the consent as an attachment</li> </ul> <p> The consent statements represent a chain that refers back to the original source consent directive. Applications may be able to follow the chain back to the source but should not generally assume that they are authorized to do this. </p> <p> <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> Directives are executed by verbal acknowledge or by being signed - either on paper, or digitally. <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/consent">Consent</a> <a href="/docs/api/fhir/datatypes/signature">Signatures</a> will be found in the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> resource (example <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/consent-example-signature.html">consent</a> and  <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/provenance-consent-signature.html">signature</a>). Implementation Guides will generally  make rules about what signatures are required, and how they are to be shared and used. </p> </div>
