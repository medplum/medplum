    <div> <a name="scope"></a>  <p><strong>This resource is an <em>event</em> resource from a FHIR workflow perspective</strong> - see <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html">Workflow</a>, specifically <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html#event">Event</a>.</p>  <p> This resource captures predicted outcomes for a patient or population on the basis of source information.  Examples include: </p> <ul>   <li>A prognosis statement for a particular condition</li>   <li>Risk of health outcome (heart attack, particular type of cancer) on the basis of lifestyle factors and/or family history</li>   <li>List of potential health risks based on a patient's genetic analysis</li>   <li>A prediction of outbreak infection rates within a geography based on immunization rates</li> </ul> <p> This resource can be used to represent the results of formal scoring/decision support tools that evaluate risk.  It can also be used to capture a practitioner's subjective assessment of the patient's risk based on existing knowledge and previous experience. </p> </div>

    <div> <a name="bnr"></a>  <p> Risk assessments are a specialized type of observation.  A specialized resource is used to provide a simpler mechanism to capture of a series of risks and to associate those risks with time-ranges, probabilities, etc.  All risk assertions are captured at one time based on a single set of source inputs.  Capture of a single risk MAY be done using the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation">Observation</a> class, particularly in circumstances where it's treated as a generic observation, but for consistency, all risk assessments and prognosis SHOULD be captured using <b>RiskAssessment</b>. </p> <p> Risk assessments may be based on a variety of factors, including: </p> <ul> <li>Basic demographic information from the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient">Patient</a> or <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/group">Group</a> resources</li> <li>Various <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation">Observations</a> including vital signs, lab information, assessments, genetic information, etc.</li> <li><a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/familymemberhistory">FamilyMemberHistory</a></li> <li>Current, past and proposed therapies <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/immunization">Immunization</a>, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/procedure">Procedure</a>, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/careplan">CarePlan</a>, etc.</li> </ul> <p> Because so many resources can potentially be used, no limit is placed on what resources can be sent in <code>RiskAssessment.basis</code>.  However, some resources would be nonsensical for this use (e.g. <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/messageheader">MessageHeader</a>). </p>  <p> <b>AllergyIntolerance and <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/riskassessment">RiskAssessment</a></b></p> <p> <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/allergyintolerance">AllergyIntolerance</a> describes a specific type of risk - propensity to reaction to a substance while <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/riskassessment">RiskAssessment</a> describes  general risks to a subject, not generally based on a reaction. </p>  </div>

    <div> <a name="bnc"></a>  <p> Risk Assessments can be determined manually by health-care providers based on their professional expertise, by using an algorithmic scoring system or through a combination.  Risk assessments can also be computed by decision support systems.  <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/operationdefinition">OperationDefinitions</a> may be defined by servers to generate risk assessments based on particular combinations of source resources or other inputs. </p> </div>
