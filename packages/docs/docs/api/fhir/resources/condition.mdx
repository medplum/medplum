# Condition

A clinical condition, problem, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical concept that has risen to a level of concern. Refer to the [US Core Condition profile](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/stu3.1.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-condition.html) and the US Core [Condition Encounter](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis.html) profile.

    <div> <a name="scope"></a>  <p>Condition is one of the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html#event">event</a> resources in the FHIR <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html">workflow</a> specification.</p>  <p> This resource is used to record detailed information about a condition, problem, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical concept that has risen to a level of concern.  The condition could be a point in time diagnosis in context of an encounter, it could be an item on the practitioner’s Problem <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a>, or it could be a concern that doesn’t exist on the practitioner’s Problem <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a>.  Often times, a condition is about a clinician's assessment and assertion of a particular aspect of a patient's state of health. It can be used to record information about a disease/illness identified from application of clinical reasoning over the pathologic and pathophysiologic findings (diagnosis), or identification of health issues/situations that a practitioner considers harmful, potentially harmful and may be investigated and managed (problem), or other health issue/situation that may require ongoing monitoring and/or management (health issue/concern). </p>  <p> The condition resource may be used to record a certain health state of a patient which does not normally present a negative outcome, e.g. pregnancy.  The condition resource may be used to record a condition following a procedure, such as the condition of Amputee-BKA following an amputation procedure. </p>  <p> While conditions are frequently a result of a clinician's assessment and assertion of a particular aspect of a patient's state of health, conditions can also be expressed by the patient, related person, or any care team member. A clinician may have a concern about a patient condition (e.g. anorexia) that the patient is not concerned about.  Likewise, the patient may have a condition (e.g. hair loss) that does not rise to the level of importance such that it belongs on a practitioner’s Problem <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a>. </p>  <p> For example, each of the following conditions could rise to the level of importance such that it belongs on a problem or concern list due to its direct or indirect impact on the patient’s health.  These examples may also be represented using other resources, such as <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/familymemberhistory">FamilyMemberHistory</a>, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation">Observation</a>, or <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/procedure">Procedure</a>. </p>  <ul> <li>Unemployed</li> <li>Without transportation (or other barriers)</li> <li>Susceptibility to falls</li> <li>Exposure to communicable disease</li> <li>Family History of cardiovascular disease</li> <li>Fear of cancer</li> <li>Cardiac pacemaker</li> <li>Amputee-BKA</li> <li>Risk of Zika virus following travel to a country </li> <li>Former smoker</li> <li>Travel to a country planned (that warrants immunizations)</li> <li>Motor Vehicle Accident</li> <li>Patient has had coronary bypass graft</li> </ul>  </div>

    <div> <a name="bnr"></a>  <p>     The condition resource may be referenced by other resources as "reasons" for an action (e.g. <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/medicationrequest">MedicationRequest</a>, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/procedure">Procedure</a>, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/servicerequest">ServiceRequest</a>, etc.) </p> <p> This resource is not typically used to record information about subjective and objective information that might lead to the recording of a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/condition">Condition</a> resource. Such signs and symptoms are typically captured using the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation">Observation</a> resource; although in some cases a persistent symptom, e.g. fever, headache may be captured as a condition before a definitive diagnosis can be discerned by a clinician.   By contrast, headache may be captured as an <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation">Observation</a> when it contributes to the establishment of a meningitis <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/condition">Condition</a>. </p> <p> Use the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation">Observation</a> resource when a symptom is resolved without long term management, tracking, or when a symptom contributes to the establishment of a condition. </p> <p> Use <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/condition">Condition</a> when a symptom requires long term management, tracking, or is used as a proxy for a diagnosis or problem that is not yet determined. </p> <p> When the diagnosis is related to an allergy or intolerance, the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/condition">Condition</a> and <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/allergyintolerance">AllergyIntolerance</a> resources can both be used.  However, to be actionable for decision support, using <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/condition">Condition</a> alone is not sufficient as the allergy or intolerance condition needs to be represented as an <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/allergyintolerance">AllergyIntolerance</a>. </p>  </div>
