<div> <p> The existing <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</Link> resource is constricted to use cases where <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claims</Link> are sent to insurances for reimbursement, in a message-like style. It neither references <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitem">ChargeItems</Link> nor <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/account">Accounts</Link>. </p><p> Competing invoicing standards such as EDIFACT or X12 are aiming at inter-organizational exchange and do not offer human readable representations or traceable links to services rendered which is a requirement for invoicing towards patients. This resource is used where existing <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitem">ChargeItems</Link> in an <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/account">Account</Link> are collected to create an <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/invoice">Invoice</Link> to be sent out to Individuals or <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/organization">Organizations</Link> in a structured way. The invoice is the hospital's view, whereas the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</Link> is the payer's view on the performed services.</p> <p> Since the individual <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitem">ChargeItem</Link> resources that make up the line items of the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/invoice">Invoice</Link> do not carry any pricing information, <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitemdefinition">ChargeItemDefinitions</Link> will have to be applied to the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitem">ChargeItems</Link> in order to calculate the price components for the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/invoice">Invoice</Link> depending on the context of the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitem">ChargeItem</Link></p> </div>
