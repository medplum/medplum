    <div>      <p> The existing <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</a> resource is constricted to use cases where <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claims</a> are sent to insurances for reimbursement, in a message-like style. It neither references <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitem">ChargeItems</a> nor <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/account">Accounts</a>. </p><p> Competing invoicing standards such as EDIFACT or X12 are aiming at inter-organizational exchange and do not offer human readable representations or traceable links to services rendered which is a requirement for invoicing towards patients.  This resource is used where existing <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitem">ChargeItems</a> in an <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/account">Account</a> are collected to create an <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/invoice">Invoice</a> to be sent out to Individuals or <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/organization">Organizations</a> in a structured way.  The invoice is the hospital's view, whereas the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</a> is the payer's view on the performed services.</p> <p> Since the individual <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitem">ChargeItem</a> resources that make up the line items of the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/invoice">Invoice</a> do not carry any pricing information, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitemdefinition">ChargeItemDefinitions</a> will have to be applied to the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitem">ChargeItems</a> in order to calculate the price components for the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/invoice">Invoice</a> depending on the context of the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitem">ChargeItem</a></p>   </div>
