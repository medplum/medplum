# Questionnaire

A structured set of questions intended to guide the collection of answers from end-users. <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaires</Link> provide detailed control over order, presentation, phraseology and grouping to allow coherent, consistent data collection.

<div> <a name="scope"></a> <p> A <b>Questionnaire</b> is an organized collection of questions intended to solicit information from patients, providers or other individuals involved in the healthcare domain.  They may be simple flat lists of questions or can be hierarchically organized in groups and sub-groups, each containing questions.  The <b>Questionnaire</b> defines the questions to be asked, how they are ordered and grouped, any intervening instructional text and what the constraints are on the allowed answers.  The results of a <b>Questionnaire</b> can be communicated using the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaireresponse">QuestionnaireResponse</a> resource. </p> <p> <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaires</Link> cover the need to communicate data originating from forms used in medical history examinations, research questionnaires and sometimes full clinical specialty records. In many systems this data is collected using user-defined screens and forms. <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaires</Link> define specifics about data capture - exactly what questions were asked, in what order, what choices for answers were, etc. Each of these questions is part of the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaire</Link>, and as such the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaire</Link> is a separately identifiable Resource, whereas the individual questions are not.  (Questionnaire questions can be linked to shared data elements using the <code>Questionnaire.item.definition</code> element.) </p> <p>Examples of <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaires</Link> include:</p> <ul> <li>Past medical history (PMH)</li> <li>Family diseases</li> <li>Social history</li> <li>Research questionnaires/Clinical research forms (CRFs)</li> <li>Quality and evaluation forms</li> <li>Patient intake form (e.g. clipboard)</li> <li>Forms to support insurance claims</li> </ul> <p> This resource is limited in scope to support the characteristics of simple questionnaires.  However, common extensions have been defined to allow more sophisticated behavior.  This includes: </p> <ul>   <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-extensions.html">Questionnaire core extensions</a> which defines the additional descriptive characteristics for questionnaires and their groups and questions</li>   <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/element-extensions.html">Element extensions</a> which can describe additional constraints on allowed answers for questionnaires such as string length and date and numeric ranges</li> </ul> <p> Additional implementation guides, in particular the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/#sdc">Structured Data Capture <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaire</Link> IG</a> provide guidance, extensions and operations that support additional capabilities and allow the definition of more sophisticated questionnaires and their corresponding responses. </p> </div>

  <TabItem value="relationships" label="Relationships">
<div> <a name="bnr"></a> <p> <b>Questionnaires</b> differ from <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">Lists</a> because <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">Lists</a> group existing resources, while <b>Questionnaires</b> group arbitrary questions. <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaires</Link> are distinct from <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation">Observations</a> and <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/diagnosticreport">DiagnosticReports</a> in that both of these resources are intended to capture only certain types of information (lab, imaging, vitals, etc.) and should not be used to capture the full breadth of healthcare information (allergies, medications, care plans, etc.), while <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaires</Link> are able to capture any information at all.  More importantly, <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation">Observation</Link> and <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/diagnosticreport">DiagnosticReport</Link> focus on capturing the discrete information in a standardized form so that the information can be used consistently regardless of where or how it is captured.  <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaire</Link> focuses on information capture.  The same information can be captured using a wide variety of questionnaires with differently phrased questions organized in different manners.  As such, the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaire</Link> resource provides a means to standardize the information gathering process (how information is captured), but not how data is interoperably compared, analyzed or computed upon (typically managed using <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation">Observation</Link>, <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/diagnosticreport">DiagnosticReport</Link> as well as other resources). </p> <p> <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaire</Link> supports data-collection workflow to a limited extent, in that - once triggered - a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaire</Link> can guide a user through a data collection process that ensures appropriate information is collected based on answers to particular questions.  However, <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaire</Link> doesn't provide support for capturing sets of information at different times or highly interactive data capture.  Broader workflow is typically managed using <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/plandefinition">PlanDefinition</Link> and <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/task">Task</Link> or using other mechanisms such as CDSHooks. </p> <p> <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaires</Link> are similar to the notion of "logical models" supported by the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/structuredefinition">StructureDefinition</a> resource.  Both support the representation of a collection of data points with labels, data types and hierarchy.  It will be common to find the two of them mapped together.  The primary difference is that <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaire</Link> is focused on user-facing data collection.  It describes specific questions and includes information such as what number/label should be displayed beside each question, conditions in which questions should be displayed (or not), what instructions should be provided to the user, etc.  <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/structuredefinition">StructureDefinition</Link>, on the other hand, merely defines a data structure with no guidance on display or rules around capture mechanism, only what data should exist in the end.  As well, logical models are not intended to capture data directly.  Rather, they provide a basis for mapping between data capture structures. </p> </div>

<div> <a name="bnc"></a> <p> <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/group">Groups</Link> and questions that make up a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaire</Link> can use the <code>definition</code> element to refer to data elements in external code systems and <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/structuredefinition">StructureDefinitions</a>.  In this way, it's possible to leverage standard definitions of questions and their associated data types and answer sets across questionnaires. This also allows extraction of the data from a questionnaire response into other data structures (e.g. populating a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/servicerequest">ServiceRequest</a> or <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/careplan">CarePlan</a> from information in a completed questionnaire response. It can also support other sorts of post-processing of the data contained in a questionnaire response. However, use of the definition element is not required and <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaires</Link> may be quite loosely defined. The section <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/#qversusr">Questionnaire versus Resources</a> below discusses the issues of collecting data in such loosely defined <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire">Questionnaires</Link> versus collecting data as well-defined separate Resources. </p> </div>
