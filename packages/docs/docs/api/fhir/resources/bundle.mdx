  <TabItem value="usage" label="Usage">
<div> <a name="scope"></a> <p> One common operation performed with resources is to gather a collection of resources into a single instance with containing context. In FHIR this is referred to as "bundling" the resources together. These resource bundles are useful for a variety of different reasons, including: </p> <ul>   <li>Returning a set of resources that meet some criteria as part of a server operation (see <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#search">RESTful Search</a>)</li>   <li>Returning a set of versions of resources as part of the history operation on a server  (see <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#history">History</a>)</li>   <li>Sending a set of resources as part of a message exchange (see <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/messaging.html">Messaging</a>)</li>   <li>Grouping a self-contained set of resources to act as an exchangeable and persistable collection with clinical integrity - e.g. a clinical document (see <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/documents.html">Documents</a>)</li>   <li>Creating/updating/deleting a set of resources on a server as a single operation (including doing so as a single atomic transaction) (see <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#transaction">Transactions</a>)</li>   <li>Storing a collection of resources</li> </ul> </div>

<div> <a name="bnr"></a> <p> There are two ways to collect resources together for transport and persistence purposes - <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/references.html#contained">contained resources</a>, and bundles. There is an important difference between the two:  </p> <ul>  <li>Contained resources are "in" the container resource - they can only ever be interpreted and/or changed in the context of the container</li>  <li>A bundle is a collection of resources that can have an independent existence - for example, they might also be accessed directly using the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html">RESTful API</a></li> </ul> <p> In addition to these two technical mechanisms, there are three administrative and infrastructure resources which also support grouping of content.  These resources do not contain resources directly, but instead use [Reference] to point to the grouped resources: </p> <ul> <li> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> resource – Enumerates a flat collection of resources and provides features for managing the collection.   While a particular <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</Link> instance may represent a "snapshot", from a business process perspective the notion of "List"  is dynamic – items are added and removed over time.  The list resource references other resources.  <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">Lists</Link> may be  curated and have specific business meaning. </li> <li> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/group">Group</a> resource – Defines a group of specific people, animals, devices, etc. by enumerating them,  or by describing qualities that group members have. The group resource refers to other resources, possibly implicitly.   <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/group">Groups</Link> are intended to be acted upon or observed as a whole; e.g. performing therapy on a group, calculating risk for a group,  etc.  This resource will commonly be used for public health (e.g. describing an at-risk population), clinical trials (e.g.  defining a test subject pool) and similar purposes. </li> <li> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> resource – Defines a set of healthcare-related information that is assembled  together into a single logical document that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, establishes its own context and  that has clinical attestation with regard to who is making the statement. The composition resource provides the basic structure  of a FHIR <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/documents.html">document</a>.  The full content of the document is expressed using a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/bundle">Bundle</Link>.  <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Compositions</Link> will  often reference <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">Lists</Link> as the focus of particular sections. </li> </ul> <p> These three resources represent meaningful groupings of the resources they refer to (e.g. a discharge medication <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</Link>, a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/group">Group</Link> of  participants for a clinical trial, a set of resources that form a signed document), while a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/bundle">Bundle</Link> is merely is a container for  resources used for transfer and storage. This list is not exhaustive; other resources also provde grouping functionality. </p> </div>
