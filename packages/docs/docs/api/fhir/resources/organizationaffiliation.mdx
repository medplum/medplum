    <div> <a name="bnr"></a>  <p> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/organization">Organization</a>.partOf is used to form a hierarchical relationships within an organization which eventually resolves  to a single organization. Each child in the tree is a subdivision of the parent.<br/> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/organizationaffiliation">OrganizationAffiliation</a> is used to describe the relationship between two distinct organizations. It does not require a hierarchical relationship. A resource instance is for a singular linkage between 2 organizations (it does not contain all members), to create multiple affiliations, create additional resources for the other relationship between other organizations.<br/> Each instance contains its own period, and optionally links to specific related services/locations that are available. These referenced locations/services should be associated with the participating organization, and are available to the primary organization. </p> <p> This resource should not be used when the affiliates are part of a single organization. </p> </div>
