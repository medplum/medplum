# AuditEvent

A record of an event made for purposes of maintaining a security log. Typical uses include detection of intrusion attempts and monitoring for inappropriate usage.

<div> <a name="bnc"></a> <p> All actors - such as applications, processes, and services - involved in an auditable event should record an <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/auditevent">AuditEvent</Link>.  This will likely result in multiple <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/auditevent">AuditEvent</Link> entries that show whether privacy and security  safeguards, such as access control, are properly functioning across an enterprise's system-of-systems.  Thus, it is typical to get an auditable event recorded by both the application in a workflow process and the servers that support them.  For this reason, duplicate entries are expected, which is helpful because it may aid in the detection of. For example,  fewer than expected actors being recorded in a multi-actor process or attributes related to those records being in  conflict, which is an indication of a security problem. There may be non-participating actors, such as trusted intermediary, that also detect a security relevant event and thus would record  an <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/auditevent">AuditEvent</Link>, such as a trusted intermediary. </p> <p> Security relevant events are not limited to communications or RESTful events. They include:  </p> <ul> <li>software start-up and shutdown;</li> <li>user login and logout; </li> <li>access control decisions; </li> <li>configuration events; </li> <li>software installation; </li> <li>policy rules changes; and </li> <li>manipulation of data that exposes the data to users. </li> </ul> <p> See the  <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-audit-event-sub-type.html">Audit Event Sub-Type</a> vocabulary for guidance on some security relevant events. </p> <p> The content of an <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/auditevent">AuditEvent</Link> is intended for use by security system administrators, security and privacy information  managers, and records management personnel.  This content is not intended to be accessible or used directly by other  healthcare users, such as providers or patients, although reports generated from the raw data would be useful. An  example is a patient-centric accounting of disclosures or an access report. Servers that provide support for <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/auditevent">AuditEvent</Link> resources would not generally accept update or delete operations on the resources, as this would compromise  the integrity of the audit record. Access to the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/auditevent">AuditEvent</Link> would typically be limited to security, privacy,  or other system administration purposes. </p> <p> Relationship of <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/auditevent">AuditEvent</Link> and <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</Link> resources are often (though not exclusively) created by the application  responding to the create/read/query/update/delete/execute etc. event.  A <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> resource contains overlapping  information, but is a record-keeping assertion that gathers information about the context in which the information  in a resource "came to be" in its current state, e.g., whether it was created de novo or obtained from another entity  in whole, part, or by transformation. <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</Link> resources are prepared by the application that initiates the  create/update of the resource and may be persisted with the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/auditevent">AuditEvent</Link> target resource.  </p> </div>
