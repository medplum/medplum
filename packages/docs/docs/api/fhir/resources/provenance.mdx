# Provenance

Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource. <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility. <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> assertions are a form of contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own provenance. <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> statement indicates clinical significance in terms of confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has the artifact been legally authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust policies.

    <div> <a name="scope"></a>  <p> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> resource tracks information about the activity that created, revised, deleted, or signed a version of a resource, describing the entities and agents involved. This information can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability, trustworthiness, or to provide pointers for where to go to further investigate the origins of the resource and the information in it.  </p> <p> <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance resources</a> are a record-keeping assertion that gathers information about the context in which the information in a resource was obtained.  <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> resources are prepared by the application that initiates the create/update etc. of the resource. An <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/auditevent">AuditEvent</a> resource contains overlapping information, but is created as events occur, to track and audit the events.  <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/auditevent">AuditEvent</a> resources are often (though not exclusively) created by the application responding to the read/query/create/update/etc. event.  </p> </div>

  <TabItem value="relationships" label="Relationships">
    <div> <a name="bnr"></a>  <a name="overlap"></a> <p> Many other FHIR resources contain some elements that represent information about how the resource was obtained, and therefore they overlap with the  functionality of the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> resource. These properties in other resources should always be used in preference to the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> resource, and the  <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> resource should be used where additional information is required, or explicit record or provenance is desired.  </p> <p> The relationship between a resource and its provenance is established by a reference from the provenance resource to its target. In this way, provenance may be provided about any resource or version, including past versions. There may be multiple provenance records for a given resource or version of a resource. </p> </div>

  <TabItem value="backgroundAndContext" label="Background and Context">
    <div> <a name="bnc"></a>  <p> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> resource is based on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-prov-overview-20130430/">W3C <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> specification </a>,  and mappings are provided. The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> resource is tailored to fit the FHIR use-cases for provenance more directly.  In terms of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/">W3C <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> </a> the FHIR <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance resource</a> covers "Generation" of "Entity" with  respect to FHIR defined resources for creation or updating;  whereas <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/auditevent">AuditEvent</a> covers "Usage" of "Entity" and all other "Activity" as defined in W3C <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a>. </p> <p> The W3C <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> Specification has the following fundamental model: </p> <p>  </p> <p> Where: </p> <ul> <li>Entity - An entity is a physical, digital, conceptual or other kind of thing with some fixed aspects; entities may be real or imaginary.</li> <li>Agent - An agent is something that bears some form of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for another agent's activity.</li> <li>Activity - An activity is something that occurs over a time period and acts upon or with entities. It may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities.</li> </ul> <p> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> resource corresponds to a single activity that identifies a set of resources (<i>target</i>) generated by the activity. The activity also references other entities (<i>entity</i>) that were used and the agents (<i>agent</i>) that were associated with the activity.  To record multiple activities that resulted in one (<i>target</i>), record each (<i>activity</i>) in independent <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> records all pointing at that (<i>target</i>). </p> <p> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> resource depends upon having <a href="/docs/api/fhir/datatypes/reference">References</a> to all the resources, entities, and agents involved in the  activity. These <a href="/docs/api/fhir/datatypes/reference">References</a> need not be resolvable. The references must provide a unique and unambiguous identification.  If a resource, entity, or agent can have different versions that must be identified, then the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/datatypes/reference">Reference</a> must have  versioning information included. </p><p> Versioning and unique identification are not mandated for all systems that provide Resources, entities, and agents.  But, inclusion of <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> requirements may introduce requirements for versioning and unique identification on those systems </p><p> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> resource is based on leveraging the W3C <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> specification  to represent HL7 support of provenance throughout  its standards and explicitly modeled as functional capabilities in ISO/HL7 10781 EHR System Functional Model Release 2 and  ISO 21089 Trusted End-to-End Information Flows.  Mappings are provided. The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> resource is tailored to fit the  FHIR use-cases for provenance more directly. In terms of W3C <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> the FHIR <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a> resources  covers "Generation" of "Entity" with respect to FHIR defined resources for creation or updating; whereas <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/auditevent">AuditEvent</a>  covers "Usage" of "Entity" and all other "Activity" as defined in W3C <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/provenance">Provenance</a>.  </p> </div>
