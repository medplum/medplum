    <div>     <a name="scope"></a>          <p>       A task resource describes an activity that can be performed and tracks the state of       completion of that activity. It is a representation that an activity should be or has been       initiated, and eventually, represents the successful or unsuccessful completion of that       activity.     </p>     <p> Note that there are a variety of processes associated with making and processing orders.       Some orders may be handled immediately by automated systems but most require real world       actions by one or more humans. Some orders can only be processed when other real world actions       happen, such as a patient presenting themselves so that the action to be performed       can actually be performed. Often these real world dependencies are only implicit in the order       details. </p>   </div>

    <div>     <a name="bnr"></a>           <p>Task spans both intent and event and tracks the execution through to     completion. A <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/task">Task</a> is a workflow step such as cancelling an order,     fulfilling an order, signing an order, merging a set of records, admitting a     patient. In contrast, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/procedure">Procedures</a> are actions     that are intended to result in a physical or mental change to or for the     subject (for example, surgery, physiotherapy, training, counseling). A <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/task">Task</a> resource     often exists in parallel with clinical resources. For example, a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/task">Task</a> could     request fulfillment of a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/servicerequest">ServiceRequest</a>     ordering a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/procedure">Procedure</a> that would result in a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/procedure">Procedure</a>, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation">Observation</a>, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/diagnosticreport">DiagnosticReport</a>, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/imagingstudy">ImagingStudy</a> or similar resource.  Another     example would be a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/task">Task</a> that requests fulfillment of a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/communicationrequest">CommunicationRequest</a> to be performed     between various actors.</p>      <p>As stated above, the task resource tracks the state of a task, enabling     systems to ensure that tasks are completed. This information is kept     separate from the operational details necessary to complete the task, as     those details vary across and even within workflows. That detail is expected     to be carried in the referenced `focus` of the task. </p>       <p>Tasks may have named inputs and outputs. Inputs represent      information that may or must be present in order for a task to      complete. Outputs represent intermediate or final results produced by a      task. For example, in a task supporting reading of radiology image, the      inputs might include both the imaging study to be read, as well as      relevant prior images. Outputs could represent radiology measurements      as well as the Radiologist's diagnostic report. </p>      <p>Inputs and outputs are tracked by the task because workflow     management activity may automate the transfer of outputs from one task     to inputs to a subsequent task. </p>      <p>To facilitate the integration of off the shelf workflow applications     with FHIR, the task resource may reference a definition.  This     definition can represent a description of the workflow activity to be     performed, using a standard workflow description language such as BPEL,     BPMN, or XPDL, a workflow definition such as those defined in IHE     profiles, or even simple written instructions explaining a process to be     performed.</p>    </div>

    <div>     <a name="bnc"></a>          <h3 class="self-link-parent"> Using <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/task">Tasks</a> in a RESTful context <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/task.html#12.1.2.1" title="link to here" class="self-link"></a></h3>     <p>In a RESTful context, a server functions as a repository of tasks. The server itself, or       other agents are expected to monitor task activity and initiate appropriate actions to ensure       task completion, updating the status of the task as it proceeds through its various stages of       completion. These agents can be coordinated, following well choreographed business logic to       ensure that tasks are completed. <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/task">Task</a> management may also be centrally controlled using some       form of a workflow engine, in which case, the workflow engine itself may update and maintain the       task resources in the server, and through its orchestration activities ensure that tasks are       completed. The task resource enables either model of task management yet provides a       consistent view of the status of tasks being executed in support of healthcare workflows. </p>     <p>The assignment of tasks into categories by type of task, type of performer and task status       enable the server to function as a queue of work items.  This queue can be polled or subscribed       to by various agents, enabling automation of workflows in FHIR using existing search and subscription       mechanisms.  Owners, requesters, other agents (e.g. workflow managers) can thus be ready to       initiate the next steps in a complex workflow.</p>     <h3 class="self-link-parent"> <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/task">Tasks</a> State Machine <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/task.html#12.1.2.2" title="link to here" class="self-link"></a></h3>     <p>Tasks start in a Created state. Once they have been assigned to an owner they transition to       the Ready state, indicating that they are ready to be performed. Once the owner initiates       activity on the task, the task transitions to the In Progress state, indicating that work is       being performed. Upon normal completion, the task enters the Completed state. If there is a       failure during the task execution that prevents the task from being completed, it can also       enter a Failed state, indicating an abnormal termination of the task. A task in any       non-terminal state may also be Cancelled, representing an abnormal termination of the task due       to external forces, rather than an error condition.</p>     <p>Tasks in any non-terminal state (Created, Ready, In Progress) can be suspended and resumed.       When a task is suspended, it is typically resumed in the state it was in when it was       originally suspended. Suspending a task suspends all of its children as well. Resuming a task       resumes all of its children.</p>     <p>An In-progress task can also be stopped, returning it to a Ready state. This may be in       preparation for delegation or reassignment (e.g., because it cannot be completed by the       current owner), to restart a task due to a temporary failure (e.g., to reattempt completion of       the activity), or in preparation to allow others to claim the task.</p>        <p>The task history allows applications monitoring the state of a workflow to identify tasks       that are long running, perhaps stuck in some queue, to enable management activities that could       ensure completion. It also enables tracking of task statistics such as wait time, or time in       progress, or time to completion, enabling capture of important task metrics in support of       optimization and quality improvement. </p>        <blockquote class="stu-note">       <a name="dstu"></a>       <p>       <b>Note:</b> Currently, task pre-requisites can be represented using <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/task">Task</a>'s `description` element or the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/requestgroup">RequestGroup</a> resource.
