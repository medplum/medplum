Describes a comparison of an immunization event against published recommendations to determine if the administration is "valid" in relation to those recommendations.

    <div>  <a name="scope"></a>  <p> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/immunizationevaluation">ImmunizationEvaluation</a> resource is intended to cover communicating the results of an evaluation of a vaccine administration event (documented using the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/immunization">Immunization</a> resource) against a set of published recommendations (protocols). Evaluating administered doses in a patient's immunization history is central to ensuring that the patient if fully protected against vaccine-preventable diseases. It is also a necessary prerequisite to generating a customized set of immunization recommendations for the patient. </p> </div>

  <TabItem value="relationships" label="Relationships">
    <div>  <p> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/immunizationevaluation">ImmunizationEvaluation</a> resource communicates the results of an evaluation of an instance of the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/immunization">Immunization</a> resource relative to a set of published recommendations. It is intended to communicate if the vaccine administration event was "valid" or "not valid" relative to the recommendations. Once all vaccine administration events in a patient's record have been evaluated, it is then possible to generate a set of vaccination related recommendations, unique for the patient. These recommendations are communicated using the ImmunizationRecommedation resource. </p> <p> As the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/immunizationevaluation">ImmunizationEvaluation</a> resource is focused on the evaluation of a single vaccine administration event, it does not include data regarding the overall patient status relative to the recommendations used in the evaluation. For example, a total of 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine may be required for patient protection, but an instance of the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/immunizationevaluation">ImmunizationEvaluation</a> resource will be concerned with only one of the doses (although other instances of <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/immunizationevaluation">ImmunizationEvaluation</a> should exist for the other doses). The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/immunizationrecommendation">ImmunizationRecommendation</a> resource is used to convey the overall patient status (eg. a dose is due or the patient is complete) relative to the hepatitis B series. </p> </div>

    <div>  <p> Through FHIR Release 3, the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/immunization">Immunization</a> resource contained a  "protocol" backbone element which functioned as an evaluation of the vaccine administration event. Beginning in Release 4, this new resource replaces the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/immunization">Immunization</a>.protocol element. </p> </div>
