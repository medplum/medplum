# MedicationAdministration

Describes the event of a patient consuming or otherwise being administered a medication. This may be as simple as swallowing a tablet or it may be a long running infusion. Related resources tie this event to the authorizing prescription, and the specific encounter between patient and health care practitioner.

<div> <a name="scope"></a> <p> This resource covers the administration of all medications and vaccines.  Please refer to the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/immunization">Immunization</a> Resource/Profile for the treatment of vaccines. It will principally be used within care settings (including inpatient) to record the capture of medication administrations, including self-administrations of oral medications, injections, intra-venous adjustments, etc.  It can also be used in outpatient settings to record allergy shots and other non-immunization administrations.  In some cases, it might be used for home-health reporting, such as recording self-administered or even device-administered insulin.  </p>     <p>MedicationAdministration is an event resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html#event"> Workflow Event </a>     </p> </div>

If systems need to use a <b>MedicationAdministration</b> resource to capture vaccinations for workflow or other reasons, they SHOULD also create and expose an equivalent <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/immunization">Immunization</a> instance. </p> </div>
