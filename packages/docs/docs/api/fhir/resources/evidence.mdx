# Evidence

The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/evidence">Evidence</a> resource describes the conditional state (population and any exposures being compared within the population) and outcome (if specified) that the knowledge (evidence, assertion, recommendation) is about.

  <TabItem value="usage" label="Usage">
    <div> <a name="bnc"></a>   <p>The scope of the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/evidence">Evidence</a> resource is to describe the conditional state (population and exposures being considered or compared within a population) with or without the outcomes that knowledge (evidence, assertion, recommendation) is about.  The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/evidence">Evidence</a> resource is a commonly bundled series of evidence variables from the "PICO" specification of medical knowledge:  <a href="/docs/api/fhir/datatypes/population">Population</a> - the population within which exposures and outcomes are being considered  Intervention - the conditional state or exposure state being described for which one is expressing the risk of or effect on an outcome  Comparison - the alternative conditional state or alternative exposure state when one is comparing states for the effect on an outcome  Outcome - the result or effect of an intervention or exposure in a population  PICO (and its variants like PECO or PICOT) is a universal acronym used in evidence-based medicine communities to clearly express research questions and evidence findings.  The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/evidence">Evidence</a> resource allows expression of the higher-order concept for recommendations in healthcare where multiple outcomes are considered, and the higher-order concept/combination for framing research questions.</p>  </div>
