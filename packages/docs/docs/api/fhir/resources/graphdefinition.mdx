# GraphDefinition

A formal computable definition of a graph of resources - that is, a coherent set of resources that form a graph by following references. The Graph Definition resource defines a set and makes rules about the set.

    <div> <a name="scope"></a>  <p> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/graphdefinition">GraphDefinition</a> resource provides a formal computable definition of a graph of resources - that is, a coherent set of resources that form  a graph by following references. The Graph Definition resource defines a set and makes rules about the set. The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/graphdefinition">GraphDefinition</a> resource can be used to: </p> <ul>  <li>Summarize a set of profiles on resources</li>  <li>Define a graph of resources to return in a query</li>  <li>Define a graph of resources to include in a document</li>  <li>Document rules about the relationship between a set of resources e.g. must all resources concern the same patient?</li> </ul> </div>

    <div> <a name="bnr"></a>  <p> There is a close relationship between <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/structuredefinition">Profiles</a> and  <code>GraphDefinitions</code>: </p> <ul>  <li>A <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/structuredefinition">StructureDefinition</a> defines a profile, and profiles can make rules about the relationships between resources. A carefully defined set of profiles implies part of what is in a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/graphdefinition">GraphDefinition</a></li>  <li>A <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/graphdefinition">GraphDefinition</a> defines rules about the relationships between resources, and in so doing, implies some constraints that would need to be represented in their profiles</li> </ul> <p> Profiles and Graph Definitions can be used together, or separately. When used together, they should be consistent. Note, though, that a graph definition may contain a subset or a superset of the relationships explicitly described in the profiles it refers to. </p> <p> It is possible that in some circumstances, a graph definition makes incompatible rules with  the Profiles it refers to - in this case, no graph if resources will meet the constraints expressed.  Applications should - but are not required - detect when such incompatibilities arise. </p> </div>
