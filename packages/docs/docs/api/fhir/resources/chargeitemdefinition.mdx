# ChargeItemDefinition

The <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitemdefinition">ChargeItemDefinition</Link> resource provides the properties that apply to the (billing) codes necessary to calculate costs and prices. The properties may differ largely depending on type and realm, therefore this resource gives only a rough structure and requires profiling for each type of billing code system.

<div> <a name="scope"></a> <p> The <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitemdefinition">ChargeItemDefinition</Link> holds all relevant billing information pertaining to a billing code or a product. </p> <p> Many billing systems have rules associated with the code which may define whether a billing code is applicable in a specific context or whether certain billing details (surcharges, discounts) apply. <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitemdefinition">ChargeItemDefinitions</Link> may also be used to hold pricing information pertaining to only one specific instance of a product (e.g. <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/device">Device</Link>, <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/medication">Medication</Link> or <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/substance">Substance</Link>) which may be a requirement for custom made devices or medications or other products where prices vary by instance.

<div> <p> While the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitem">ChargeItem</Link> resource represents the occurrence of a billing code (for services rendered or products supplied to a specific patient), the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitemdefinition">ChargeItemDefinition</Link> represents the properties and rules that a billing engine needs to determine the pricing and applicability of a billing code in the context of a specific setting. </p><p> Billing Codes may be defined in a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/codesystem">CodeSystem</Link> Resource, however, each of these codes - if it is used in a financial context - can have a large number of business rules and properties associated with it, that lay outside the scope of <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/codesystem">CodeSystem</Link> and may change in time independently from the underlying Code's validity period. Even though <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/codesystem">CodeSystem</Link> can associate a concept with any number of additional properties, such a construct would be very hard to maintain. This is why the ChargItemDefinition has been introduced. It allows to maintain the attributes of each billing code independently and has a wider scope to also include business rules. </p><p> In most use cases, billing codes will be both defined as semantical concepts in a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/codesystem">CodeSystem</Link> and as a financial artifact in <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitemdefinition">ChargeItemDefinition</Link>. </p><p> <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitemdefinition">ChargeItemDefinitions</Link> that pertain to codes from the same <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/codesystem">CodeSystem</Link> may be aggregated using the Catalog profile for <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</Link>. </p><p> Resources representing products that can be sold or billed (Device, <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/medication">Medication</Link>, <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/substance">Substance</Link>...), do not specify financial details for the product instance. Most of the time, such products are not billed seperately but are a part of a generic billing code that covers both the product and the service rendered.  In some occasions however, product prices may vary depending on type or manufactuer or even on instance (e.g. custom made products). For these cases,  <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/chargeitemdefinition">ChargeItemDefinitions</Link> may be created to specify the financial details for a product kind, type or instance. </p> </div>
