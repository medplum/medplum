    <div> <a name="scope"></a>  <p> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> resource is a flat, possibly ordered collection of records. <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> resources are used in many places,  including allergies, medications, alerts, family history, medical history, etc. <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> resources can be used to  support patient-specific clinical lists as well as lists that manage workflows such as tracking patients, managing  teaching cases, etc. Resources supported by the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> resource can be homogeneous – consisting of only one type of  resource (e.g. allergy lists) as well as heterogeneous – containing a variety of resources (e.g. a problem list  including <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/condition">Conditions</a>, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/allergyintolerance">AllergyIntolerances</a>,  recent <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/procedure">Procedures</a>, etc.). </p> <p> <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">Lists</a> will typically include references to the resources that make up the list, however in some cases the details  of the content of the list might be expressed in narrative only; e.g. a text record of a family history.  The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a>  resource is only needed if there is a need to filter the set of resources by a mechanism that cannot be accomplished  via a simple query; e.g. there is no need to have a list for all <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/allergyintolerance">AllergyIntolerances</a> that exist on a server for a given patient.  However, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> is an appropriate mechanism to provide a filtered list of the  subset of <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/allergyintolerance">AllergyIntolerances</a> that are deemed to be "current". <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">Lists</a> are allowed to contain other <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">Lists</a>, to create a nested collection of <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">Lists</a>. </p> <p> Querying a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> of resources such as <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/allergyintolerance">AllergyIntolerance</a>, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/condition">Condition</a> or <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/medication">Medication</a>-related resources is different than querying the resource-specific endpoint. For example, a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> of <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/allergyintolerance">AllergyIntolerance</a> resources would represent a curated point-in-time snapshot of the patient's allergies and intolerances. On the other hand, querying the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/allergyintolerance">AllergyIntolerance</a> endpoint would typically produce a larger set of records as it would both be non-curated (potentially containing duplicate or out-of-date records) and current - generated based on information as of "now" rather than the last time a human manually revised the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> resource instance. Which mechanism is most appropriate for data retrieval will vary by use-case. In some cases, systems might not have an appropriate curated <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> to query. </p> <p> Note that the presence of an item in a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> resource SHALL NOT change the meaning of any information that would be  understood by looking at the item outside the context of the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a>, because items may be accessed directly outside  the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> by RESTful means or after a document is processed. For example, a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> with a code that means  "refuted conditions" cannot have items that are <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/condition">Condition</a> resources that do not have a  <code>verificationStatus</code> of <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-condition-clinical.html#refuted">refuted</a>. </p> </div>

  <TabItem value="relationships" label="Relationships">
    <div> <a name="bnr"></a>  <p> There are five mechanisms in FHIR for communicating collections of resources: </p> <ul> <li> This <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> resource - enumerates a flat collection of resources and provides features for managing the collection.   While a particular <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> instance may represent a "snapshot", from a business process perspective the notion of "List"  is dynamic – items are added and removed over time.  The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</a> resource references other resources.  <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">Lists</a> may be  curated and have specific business meaning. </li> <li> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/group">Group</a> resource - defines a group of specific people, animals, devices, etc. by enumerating them,  or by describing qualities that group members have. The group resource refers to other resources, possibly implicitly.   <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/group">Groups</a> are intended to be acted upon or observed as a whole; e.g. performing therapy on a group, calculating risk for a group,  etc.  This resource will commonly be used for public health (e.g. describing an at-risk population), clinical trials (e.g. defining a test subject pool) and similar purposes. </li> <li> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> resource - defines a set of healthcare-related information that is assembled  together into a single logical document that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, establishes its own context and  that has clinical attestation with regard to who is making the statement. The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Composition</a> resource provides the basic structure  of a FHIR <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/documents.html">document</a>.  The full content of the document is expressed using a bundle.  <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/composition">Compositions</a> will  often reference <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">Lists</a> as the focus of particular sections. </li> <li> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/bundle">Bundle</a> resource - is an infrastructure container for a group of resources.  It does not have a narrative  and is used to group collections of resources for transmission, persistence or processing (e.g. messages, documents, transactions,  query responses, etc.)  The content of bundles is typically algorithmically determined for a particular exchange or persistence purpose. </li> <li> The <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/domainresource.html">DomainResource</a>.<code>contained</code> element - allows multiple resources to be nested inside any DomainResource.  This is a special type of grouping where the grouped resources lose independent existence - they no longer have their own identifiers, can't easily be queried independently, etc.  Use of this grouping is a technical  mechanism for managing the independence of resources and has no impact on meaning. Contained, bundled, and remotely referenced resources convey the same meaning. </li> </ul>  </div>
