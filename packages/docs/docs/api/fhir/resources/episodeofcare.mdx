<div> <a name="scope"></a>          <p>       The <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/episodeofcare">EpisodeOfCare</Link> Resource contains information about an association of a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient">Patient</Link> with a Healthcare Provider for a period       of time under which related healthcare activities may occur.     </p>     <p>       In many cases, this represents a period of time where the Healthcare Provider has some level of responsibility for the care       of the patient regarding a specific condition or problem, even if not currently participating in an encounter.     </p>     <p>       These resources are typically known in existing systems as:     </p>     <ul>       <li>EpisodeOfCare: Case, Program, Problem, Episode</li>       <li>Encounter: Visit, Contact</li>     </ul>     <p></p>     <h3 class="self-link-parent"> Multiple <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/organization">Organizations</Link> and Transfer of Care <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/episodeofcare.html#8.10.1.1" title="link to here" class="self-link"></a></h3>     <p>       Many organizations can be involved in an <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/episodeofcare">EpisodeOfCare</Link>; however each organization will have its own <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/episodeofcare">EpisodeOfCare</Link> resource instance       that tracks its responsibility with the patient.     </p>     <p>       When an <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/organization">Organization</Link> completes their involvement with the patient and transfers care to another <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/organization">Organization</Link>.       This is often in the form of a referral to another <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/organization">Organization</Link> (or <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/organization">Organizations</Link>).<br/>     </p>     <p>       When an incoming referral is received a new <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/episodeofcare">EpisodeOfCare</Link> may be created for this organization.       The initial step(s) in the intake workflow for the referral often involve some form of assessment(s),       eligibility, capacity, care levels, which could take some time.<br/>       Once the intake process is completed and the patient is accepted, a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/careplan">CarePlan</Link> is often created.     </p>   </div>

<div>  <a name="bnr"></a>         <p>       The primary difference between the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/episodeofcare">EpisodeOfCare</Link> and the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/encounter">Encounter</Link> is that the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/encounter">Encounter</Link> records the details of an       activity directly relating to the patient, while the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/episodeofcare">EpisodeOfCare</Link> is the container that can link a series of <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/encounter">Encounters</Link>       together for problems/issues.<br/>       The Example scenarios below give some good examples as to when you might want to be using an <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/episodeofcare">EpisodeOfCare</Link>.     </p>     <p>       This difference is a similar difference between the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/episodeofcare">EpisodeOfCare</Link> and a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/careplan">CarePlan</Link>.        The <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/episodeofcare">EpisodeOfCare</Link> is a tracking resource, rather than a planning resource.<br/>       The <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/episodeofcare">EpisodeOfCare</Link> usually exists before the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/careplan">CarePlan</Link>.       You don't need a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/careplan">CarePlan</Link> to use an <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/episodeofcare">EpisodeOfCare</Link>.     </p>   </div>

<div>  <a name="bnc"></a>         <p>       Systems collect a coherent group of activities (such as encounters) related to a patient's health condition or problem often referred to as a Care Episode.       Information about an episode is often shared across systems, and in some cases organizational and disciplinary boundaries.       An <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/episodeofcare">EpisodeOfCare</Link> contains details about the purpose of the care and can exist without any activities.<br/>       The minimal information that would be required in an episode of care would be a patient, organization and a reason for the ongoing association.       Other reasons for creating an <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/episodeofcare">EpisodeOfCare</Link> could be for tracking the details required for government reporting or billing.     </p>     <h3 class="self-link-parent"> Expected Implementations <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/episodeofcare.html#8.10.3.1" title="link to here" class="self-link"></a></h3>     <ul>       <li>Chronic Disease Management Systems</li>       <li>         Community Care Systems         <ul>           <li>Tracking progress of a specific condition</li>           <li>Tracking government funding</li>         </ul>       </li>       <li>Problem based General Practice systems</li>       <li>Disability Support Systems</li>       <li>Aged Care Systems (Community and Residential)</li>     </ul>   </div>
