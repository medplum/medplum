# CompartmentDefinition

A compartment definition that defines how resources are accessed on a server.

<div> <a name="scope"></a> <p> Each resource may belong to one or more logical compartments. A compartment is a logical  grouping of resources which share a common property. Compartments have two principal roles: </p> <ul>  <li>Function as an access mechanism for finding a set of related resources quickly</li>  <li>Provide a definitional basis for applying access control to resources quickly</li> </ul> <p><b>Note:</b></p> <p> At present, compartment definitions can <i>only</i> be defined by HL7 International.  This is because their existence creates significant impact on the behavior of servers. </p> </div>

<div>  <a name="bnr"></a>   <p> Compartment definitions describe how particular compartment instances are named and identified, and how systems know which resources are in the compartment. The following compartments are  defined by this specification: </p> <table class="grid">  <tbody><tr><td><b>Title</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td><td><b>Identity</b></td><td><b>Membership</b></td></tr>  <tr><td><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/compartmentdefinition-patient.html">Patient</a></td><td>The set of resources associated with a particular patient</td><td>There is an instance of the patient compartment for each patient resource, and the identity of the compartment is the same as the patient. When a patient is linked to another patient, all the records associated with the linked patient are in the compartment associated with the target of the link.</td><td>The patient compartment includes any resources where the subject of  the resource is the patient, and some other resources that are directly linked  to resources in the patient compartment</td></tr>  <tr><td><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/compartmentdefinition-encounter.html">Encounter</a></td><td>The set of resources associated with a particular encounter</td><td>There is an instance of the encounter compartment for each encounter resource, and the identity of the compartment is the same as the encounter</td><td>The encounter compartment includes any resources where the resource has an explicitly nominated encounter, and some other resources that themselves link  to resources in the encounter compartment. Note that for many resources, the exact nature of the link to encounter can be ambiguous (e.g. for a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/diagnosticreport">DiagnosticReport</Link>, is it the encounter when it was initiated, or when it was reported?)</td></tr>  <tr><td><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/compartmentdefinition-relatedperson.html">RelatedPerson</a></td><td>The set of resources associated with a particular 'related person'</td><td>There is an instance of the relatedPerson compartment for each relatedPerson resource, and the identity of the compartment is the same as the relatedPerson</td><td>The relatedPerson compartment includes any resources where the resource is explicitly linked to relatedPerson (usually as author)</td></tr>  <tr><td><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/compartmentdefinition-practitioner.html">Practitioner</a></td><td>The set of resources associated with a particular practitioner</td><td>There is an instance of the practitioner compartment for each <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/practitioner">Practitioner</Link> resource, and the identity of the compartment is the same as the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/practitioner">Practitioner</Link></td><td>The practitioner compartment includes any resources where the resource is explicitly linked to a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/practitioner">Practitioner</Link> (usually as author, but other kinds of linkage exist)</td></tr>  <tr><td><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/compartmentdefinition-device.html">Device</a></td><td>The set of resources associated with a particular device</td><td>There is an instance of the device compartment for each <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/device">Device</Link> resource, and the identity of the compartment is the same as the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/device">Device</Link></td><td>The device compartment includes any resources where the resource is explicitly linked to a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/device">Device</Link> (mostly subject or performer)</td></tr> </tbody></table> <p> The full definitions of these compartments are published as <code>CompartmentDefinition</code> resources. Servers typically do not support the full definition of a compartment, and are not  required to. Systems may publish <code>CompartmentDefinition</code> resources so that other systems may make use of compartments properly. </p> <ul>  <li>CompartmentDefinitions are used by <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/capabilitystatement">CapabilityStatement</a> instances for specifying how resources are accessed</li> </ul> </div>
