    <div>   <a name="bnc"> </a>      <p> <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/specimendefinition">SpecimenDefinition</a> will define a kind of specimen, which can be associated with in vitro diagnostic procedures described in a catalog of orderable services. <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/specimendefinition">SpecimenDefinition</a> describes the kind of specimen to be collected from the subject of these procedures as well as the requirements applying to the collection activity, the preparation of the subject for this collection. This resource also describes the associated type(s) of specimen conditioned for testing, which are the output of the specimen collection activity. A specimen conditioned for testing is described with the type(s) of container and possible additive to be used, the minimal and normal volumes of collection, the conditions of storage, transportation and handling for the specimen once collected and conditioned. This resource is a necessary building block of a sharable catalog of orderable in vitro diagnostic services. The subjects of these orderable services may be human patients, non-human living subjects or non-living materials such as water, surfaces, medical devices, etc. All sub-specialties of clinical and anatomic pathology laboratories are concerned, as well as all care services prone to order in vitro diagnostic services to those laboratories. A catalog of orderable services generally belongs to a specific laboratory or facility. Nonetheless, the data items used to build this catalog are of universal meaning and interest.      </p>  </div>
