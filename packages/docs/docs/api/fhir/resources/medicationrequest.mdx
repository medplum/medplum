# MedicationRequest

An order or request for both supply of the medication and the instructions for administration of the medication to a patient. The resource is called "MedicationRequest" rather than "MedicationPrescription" or "MedicationOrder" to generalize the use across inpatient and outpatient settings, including care plans, etc., and to harmonize with workflow patterns. Refer to the [US Core Medication Request profile](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/stu3.1.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-medicationrequest.html).

    <div> <a name="scope"></a>  <p>     This resource covers all type of orders for medications for a patient. This includes inpatient medication orders as well as community orders (whether filled by the prescriber or by a pharmacy). It also includes orders for over-the-counter medications (e.g. Aspirin), total parenteral nutrition and diet/ vitamin supplements. It may be used to support the order of medication-related devices. It is not intended for use in prescribing particular diets, or for ordering non-medication-related items (eyeglasses, supplies, etc.).  In addition, the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/medicationrequest">MedicationRequest</a> may be used to report orders/request from external systems that have been reported for informational purposes and are not authoritative and are not expected to be acted upon (e.g. dispensed or administered). </p>     <p>The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/medicationrequest">MedicationRequest</a> resource is a "request" resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html#request">Workflow Request.</a></p>   <p> The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/medicationrequest">MedicationRequest</a> resource allows requesting only a single medication. If a workflow requires requesting multiple items simultaneously, this is done using multiple instances of this resource. These instances can be linked in different ways, depending on the needs of the workflow. For guidance, refer to <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/request.html#compound">the Request pattern</a> </p> </div>
