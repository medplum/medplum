# MedicationStatement

A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient. A <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/medicationstatement">MedicationStatement</Link> may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future. The source of this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician. A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay. The medication information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle, or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains. The primary difference between a medication statement and a medication administration is that the medication administration has complete administration information and is based on actual administration information from the person who administered the medication. A medication statement is often, if not always, less specific. There is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise. As stated earlier, the medication statement information may come from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains. <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/medication">Medication</Link> administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.

This would typically be done if these substances are intended to be included in clinical decision support checking (for example, interaction checking) and as part of an active medication list.  If the intent is to populate social history and/or to include additional information (for example, desire to quit, amount per day, negative health effects), then it is better to record as an <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation">Observation</Link> that could then be used to populate Social History.</p>         <p> This resource does not produce a medication list, but it does produce individual             medication statements that may be used in the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/list">List</Link> resource to construct various types             of medication lists. Note that other medication lists can also be constructed from the             other Pharmacy resources (e.g., <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/medicationrequest">MedicationRequest</Link>, <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/medicationadministration">MedicationAdministration</Link>). </p><p> A             medication statement is not a part of the prescribe -&gt; dispense -&gt; administer sequence,             but is a report by a patient, significant other or a clinician that one or more of the             prescribe, dispense or administer actions has occurred, resulting is a belief that the             patient is, has, or will be using a particular medication. </p>         <p>MedicationStatement is an event resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html#event">Workflow Event</a></p>     </div>

Each of those             resources refers to specific events - an individual order, an individual provisioning of             medication or an individual dosing. <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/medicationstatement">MedicationStatement</Link> is a broader assertion covering             a wider timespan and is independent of specific events. The existence of resource             instances of any of the preceding three types may be used to infer a medication             statement. However, medication statements can also be captured on the basis of other             information, including an assertion by the patient or a care-giver, the results of a lab             test, etc. </p>  </div>
