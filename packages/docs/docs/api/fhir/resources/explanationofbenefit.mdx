    <div> <a name="scope"></a>  <p>The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/explanationofbenefit">ExplanationOfBenefit</a> (EOB) resource combines key information from a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</a>, a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claimresponse">ClaimResponse</a> and optional <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/account">Account</a> information to inform  a patient of the goods and services rendered by a provider and the settlement made under the patient's coverage in respect of that <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</a>. The  <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/explanationofbenefit">ExplanationOfBenefit</a> resource may also be used as a resource for data exchange for bulk data analysis, as the resource  encompasses <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</a>, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claimresponse">ClaimResponse</a> and <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverage">Coverage</a>/Eligibility information. </p> <p> This is the logical combination of the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</a>, <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claimresponse">ClaimResponse</a> and some <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverage">Coverage</a> accounting information  in respect of a single payor prepared for consumption by the subscriber and/or patient. It is not   simply a series of pointers to referred-to content models, is a physical subset scoped to the   adjudication by a single payor which details the services rendered, the amounts to be settled and   to whom, and optionally the coverage allowed under the policy and the amounts used to date. </p> <p> Typically the EOB is only used to convey <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</a> (use=claim) and the associated <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claimresponse">ClaimResponse</a> information to patients or subscribers. It may also be   used to convey consolidated predetermination and preauthorization request and response information to patients or subscribers. An EOB will never   be created for patient or subscriber information exchange if an error was detected in the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</a>.  </p> <p> It is also recognized that "EOB" is a term that carries additional meaning in certain areas of the industry. When the resource was originally  being developed there was substantial discussion about the adoption of an alternative name for the resource but after much discussion it was  resolved that the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/explanationofbenefit">ExplanationOfBenefit</a> name has the advantage of familiarity that has been proven through the early adoption of the resource  for multiple purposes.  </p> <p><b>Note:</b> when creating profiles for EOB as a patient focused information exchange the payment details, other than date, should be excluded if  the payee is the provider as that would leak business confidential information.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> the EOB <b>SHALL NOT</b> be used as a replacement for a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claimresponse">ClaimResponse</a> when responding to <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claims</a>. Only the <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claimresponse">ClaimResponse</a> contains  the appropriate adjudication information for a payor response to a <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/explanationofbenefit">ExplanationOfBenefit</a> resource is an "event" resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html#event">Workflow Event.</a></p> <h3 class="self-link-parent"> Additional Information <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/explanationofbenefit.html#13.10.1.1" title="link to here" class="self-link"></a></h3> <p> Additional information regarding electronic claims content and usage may be found at: </p>   <ul> <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/financial-module.html#resource-status">Financial Resource Status Lifecycle</a>: how .status is used in the financial resources.</li> <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/financial-module.html#secondary-use">Secondary Use of Resources</a>: how resources such as <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</a> and <a href="/docs/api/fhir/resources/explanationofbenefit">ExplanationOfBenefit</a> may used for    reporting and data exchange for analytics, not just for eClaims exchange between providers and payors.</li> <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/financial-module.html#subrogation">Subrogation</a>: how eClaims may handle patient insurance coverages when another insurer rather than  the provider will settle the claim and potentially recover costs against specified coverages.</li> <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/financial-module.html#cob">Coordination of Benefit</a>: how eClaims may handle multiple patient insurance coverages.</li> <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/financial-module.html#real-time">RealTime Exchange and Obtaining EOBs</a>: EOBs may be obtained using Polling or FHIR REST (SEARCH).</li> <li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/financial-module.html#attachments">Attachments and Supporting Information</a>: how eClaims may handle the provision of supporting  information, whether provided by content or reference, within the eClaim resource when submitted to the payor or later in a resource which refers  to the subject eClaim resource.
