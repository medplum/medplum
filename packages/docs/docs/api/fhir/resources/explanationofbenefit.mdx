<div> <a name="scope"></a> <p>The <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/explanationofbenefit">ExplanationOfBenefit</Link> (EOB) resource combines key information from a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</Link>, a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claimresponse">ClaimResponse</Link> and optional <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/account">Account</Link> information to inform  a patient of the goods and services rendered by a provider and the settlement made under the patient's coverage in respect of that <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</Link>. The  <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/explanationofbenefit">ExplanationOfBenefit</Link> resource may also be used as a resource for data exchange for bulk data analysis, as the resource  encompasses <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</Link>, <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claimresponse">ClaimResponse</Link> and <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverage">Coverage</Link>/Eligibility information. </p> <p> This is the logical combination of the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</Link>, <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claimresponse">ClaimResponse</Link> and some <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverage">Coverage</Link> accounting information  in respect of a single payor prepared for consumption by the subscriber and/or patient. It is not   simply a series of pointers to referred-to content models, is a physical subset scoped to the   adjudication by a single payor which details the services rendered, the amounts to be settled and   to whom, and optionally the coverage allowed under the policy and the amounts used to date. </p> <p> Typically the EOB is only used to convey <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</Link> (use=claim) and the associated <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claimresponse">ClaimResponse</Link> information to patients or subscribers. It may also be   used to convey consolidated predetermination and preauthorization request and response information to patients or subscribers. An EOB will never   be created for patient or subscriber information exchange if an error was detected in the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claim</Link>.  </p> <p> It is also recognized that "EOB" is a term that carries additional meaning in certain areas of the industry. When the resource was originally  being developed there was substantial discussion about the adoption of an alternative name for the resource but after much discussion it was  resolved that the <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/explanationofbenefit">ExplanationOfBenefit</Link> name has the advantage of familiarity that has been proven through the early adoption of the resource  for multiple purposes.  </p> <p><b>Note:</b> when creating profiles for EOB as a patient focused information exchange the payment details, other than date, should be excluded if  the payee is the provider as that would leak business confidential information.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> the EOB <b>SHALL NOT</b> be used as a replacement for a <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claimresponse">ClaimResponse</Link> when responding to <Link to="/docs/api/fhir/resources/claim">Claims</Link>.
