# API Overview

Welcome to the Medplum API documentation!

**Storing Healthcare Data**: Our [**TypeScript SDK**](./sdk/classes/MedplumClient) provides a powerful, type-safe library to create and store healthcare data in the Medplum CDR.

**Building Healthcare Apps**: If you're building a [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) app with Medplum, our [**React Components**](./api/react-components) can give you building blocks to get you started.

**FHIR Data Model**: For documentation on all the FHIR Resources that Medplum supports, check out our [**FHIR API docs**](./api/fhir) (and if you're asking yourself, "_What's FHIR?_", check out our [FHIR Basics page](/docs/fhir-basics.md) )
