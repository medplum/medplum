# Insurance Eligibility Checks

Insurance eligibility checks determine whether a patient's insurance is active, in-network, and has applicable benefits. They ensure that the provider will ultimately get compensated by the patient's insurer for a specific product or service.

## Use Cases

Insurance eligibility checks cover a variety of use cases, but generally they are used to answer three questions:

1. Is this insurance active?
2. Does this insurance cover basic visits to a provider?
3. Does this insurance cover a specific service type?

The most basic use case for an eligibility check is simply seeing if the policy is active and inforce.

Adding a second layer is checking if the policy is active and also covers basic visits to a provider. These include appointments like phsyicals and check-ups and is the most common type of eligibility request.

Because it is so common, these types of requests are defined by the [X12 Service Type Codes](https://x12.org/codes/service-type-codes) in **service code 30**. This service type is "Plan Coverage and General Benefits", and checks for active basic coverage.

Two common use cases for this service type are:

- Checking that a new patient's coverage is active and has general benefits.
- Checking coverage directly prior to a visit to ensure that the policy has not changed and the patient is still covered.

Finally, checking that insurance covers a specific service type adds a third layer to an eligibility check. These are done to ensure that a patient is covered for more complex care. It is recommended to use the [X12 Service Type Codes](https://x12.org/codes/service-type-codes) to illustrate the type of care that is being checked.

For example, if a patient needs to purchase durable medical equipment, you would use **service code 12**. This code represents "Durable Medical Equipment Purchased".

It is important to note that you should be checking the _service type_ to be provided, not the _specific service_, which is exactly what the [X12 Service Type Codes](https://x12.org/codes/service-type-codes) are designed to do.

## Preparing an Eligibility Check

FHIR follows a request/response pattern for eligibility checks. This uses two resources: the [`CoverageEligibilityRequest`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverageeligibilityrequest) to model the request to the insurer and the [`CoverageEligibilityResponse`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverageeligibilityresponse) to model their response.

To complete an eligibility check, you will need the following information:

- Patient demographic info, modeled as a reference to a [`Patient`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient) resource.
- Patient insurance coverage, modeled as a reference to a [`Coverage`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverage) resource (see our [insurance guide](/docs/billing/patient-insurance) for more info).
- Provider info, modeled as a reference to the relevant [`Practitioner`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/practitioner), [`PractitionerRole`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/practitionerrole), or [`Organization`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/organization) (see the [provider network guide](/docs/fhir-datastore/provider-directory/provider-networks) for more info).
- The procedure/service to be provided and the diagnosis. This information should be on the relevant [`Encounter`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/encounter) (see our [blog post on Well Defined Service Menus](https://www.medplum.com/blog#well-defined-service-menu) for more info).

## Creating a Request

FHIR provides the [`CoverageEligibilityRequest`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverageeligibilityrequest) resource to model a request for an insurance eligibility check.

## Sending an Eligibility Check Request

Once you have created your [`CoverageEligibilityRequest`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverageeligibilityrequest), you need to send it to the insurer.

In addition to sending it directly to the insurer, there are services that simplify the process. Companies such as [Opkit](https://www.opkit.co/), [Availty](https://www.availity.com/), [Change Healthcare](https://www.changehealthcare.com/), [Waystar](https://www.waystar.com/) and [Candid Health](https://www.joincandidhealth.com/) allow you to send them eligibility checks directly.

Unfortunately, these companies format their requests based on [X12 EDI Format](https://x12.org/examples/005010x279) rather than FHIR, so you will need to convert your [`CoverageEligibilityRequest`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverageeligibilityrequest) to the correct format. This is a good workflow to implement [Bots](/docs/bots/bot-basics) to convert your request, interface with the company's API, and send the request. Additionally, you can have a [Subscription](/docs/subscriptions) to listen for a response and have a bot handle that as well.

## Receiving a Response

When you send your request, the insurer will review it and respond. This response will be modeled as a [`CoverageEligibilityResponse`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverageeligibilityresponse).

### The Covered Items

Like its request counterpart, the [`CoverageEligibilityResponse`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverageeligibilityresponse) also has an `item` element, however it is a property on the `insurance` element rather than directly on the resource (e.g. `CoverageEligibilityResponse.insurance.item` vs `CoverageEligibilityRequest.item`). The `item` property contains details about allowed products and services under the insurance policy.

This field has some overlap with the request resource, but there are also significant differences between the two.

:::note Coordination of Benefits
FHIR makes the `insurance` field on both the request and response an array, allowing for coordination of benefits across multiple insurance policies.

When sending a request, if there are multiple insurances, the `CoverageEligibilityRequest.insurance.focal` field should be set to `true` on the specific coverage being checked.

The `item` field is also an array on the `insurance` element of a [`CoverageEligibilityResponse`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverageeligibilityresponse) because it can represent multiple items that are covered under a specific insurance. When coordinating care among multiple policies, it can be common for multiple items from multiple coverages to be relevant to the check.
