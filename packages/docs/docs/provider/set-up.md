This section covers the initial setup process for your Medplum system, including how to add practitioners and import existing data through the Medplum App.

## **Adding Practitioners (via Medplum App)**

Setting up practitioners is one of the first steps in configuring your Medplum system and will need to be completed using the Medplum App ([app.medplum.com](https://app.medplum.com/)). Practitioners represent healthcare providers, clinicians, and other staff members who will be using the system.

### **Prerequisites**

* Administrative access to the Medplum App  
* Practitioner information including names, credentials, and contact details  
* Valid email addresses for each practitioner (required for system access)

### **How to Add Practitioners**

1. **Access the Project Users Page**  
   * Log into the Medplum App with your administrator credentials  
   * Select "Project" from the left navigation menu
   * Then, select the "Users" tab
2. **Add & Invite a New Practitioner**  
   * On the Users page, click the "Invite New User" link at the bottom of the page  
   * Choose "Practitioner" for this user's Role and add the other required information
   * If applicable, choose an Access Policy and/or check if you'd like for this user to be an "Admin" or "Project Scoped" (only added to this project)
      * See out [User Management Guide](https://www.medplum.com/docs/auth/user-management-guide) for details on this
   * Check "Send email" if you'd like to send an automated email invite to this practitioner (recommended)
   * Click the "Invite" button to add and invite this practitioner
