# Tasks

The Tasks section serves as a centralized management system for coordinating patient care activities across your entire clinical and administrative team. Tasks enable providers, nurses, and support staff to create, assign, track, and complete action items related to patient care, follow-ups, administrative duties, and/or operational workflows.
