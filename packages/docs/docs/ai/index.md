# Build with AI on Medplum

The promise of AI in healthcare has never been greater, but the reality for developers is often a series of frustrating roadblocks. You've built and validated an amazing modelâ€”but now what? How do you get it into production? How do you connect it to messy, unstructured clinical data? How do you ensure it fits seamlessly into a clinical workflow?

We built Medplum to solve these problems.

Medplum is an **API-first, open-source platform** designed to be the foundational data layer for your AI applications. We provide the structure and tools you need so you can focus on what matters: building intelligent healthcare solutions.

## The Medplum Advantage: Why We're Built for AI

Our team of industry veterans built Medplum from years of firsthand experience with the pain of deploying machine learning models in a clinical setting. We understand that a great AI model is useless if it can't be integrated reliably.

Medplum's architecture is a perfect match for modern AI:

- **API-First:** Our platform is built on open standards like **FHIR** and **OAuth**. This means AI models can consume and produce structured, standardized data reliably, eliminating the "last mile" problem of getting data in and out of your applications.
- **Open Source:** Build and deploy your models without vendor lock-in. Our open-source foundation provides transparency, flexibility, and a community-driven environment where you can innovate without proprietary constraints.
- **Structured Data:** We turn messy, unstructured clinical data into clean, structured resources. This is the critical first step for any AI model, and we handle the heavy lifting so your models get the high-quality input they need to perform.
