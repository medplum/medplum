## What is Medplum?

Medplum is a **headless EHR**. Using [Medplum products](./products) you can build many [types of healthcare applications](./solutions). The diagram below is a system overview:

![Medplum system overview](/img/medplum-overview.svg)

## Get Started

1. [Register a project](https://www.medplum.com/docs/tutorials/register) for your data. 
    1. [Optional]: [Import sample data](https://www.medplum.com/docs/tutorials/importing-sample-data). 
2. Use our [provider app](https://www.medplum.com/docs/provider) by logging in to our [out-of-the-box EHR experience](https://provider.medplum.com/). 
3. [Build your own application](https://www.medplum.com/docs/tutorials/medplum-hello-world) against our APIs. 

## Plan your Workflows

1. [Learn FHIR basics](./docs/fhir-basics) to understand the structure of FHIR resources, the healthcare standard on which Medplum is built. 
2. [Learn workflow patterns](./blog/fhir-workflow-patterns-to-simplify-your-life) to understand how resources are used to place requests, record events, and store information. 
3. Explore our docs on workflows under "Model in FHIR"! Popular workflows are included below. Step through specific use cases. Don't see a how-to guide you need? Reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/medplum) or send us an email at [support@medplum.com](mailto:support@medplum.com). 
    1. [Charting patient data](./docs/charting)
    2. [Creating and automating clinical operations](/docs/careplans/tasks)
    3. [Recording asynchronous encounters and messaging](./docs/communications/async-encounters)
    4. [Billing your services](./docs/billing)
4. [Migrate your data](./docs/migration) to Medplum. 

## Build in Medplum

1. [CRUD using our FHIR datastore](./docs/fhir-datastore), and learn to [search your data](./docs/search).
2. Explore our [React components](./docs/api/react), pre-built to support Medplum data.  
3. [Run the Medplum stack locally](./docs/self-hosting/running-full-medplum-stack-in-docker) to set up your developer environment.

## Connect to the Healthcare Ecosystem

- Get on-prem connectivity with our [Medplum Agent](./docs/agent), connecting to devices over HL7/MLLP, ASTM, and DICOM and surfacing them securely to the cloud. 
- Use [FHIRcast](./docs/fhircast) for real-time synchronization. 
- Use our out-of-the-box [labs](./docs/integration/health-gorilla), [prescribing](./docs/integration/dosespot), and [RCM](./docs/integration/stedi) integrations. 
- Explore our [full menu of integrations](./docs/integration).
