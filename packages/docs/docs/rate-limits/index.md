# Rate Limits

The Medplum API uses a number of safeguards against bursts of incoming traffic to help maximize its stability. Users who
send many requests in quick succession may receive HTTP error responses with status code `429 Too Many Requests`.

## Total Requests Rate Limit

| Category                      | Free tier                        | Paid tier                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Auth (`/auth/*`, `/oauth2/*`) | 60 request per IP per minute     | 60 request per IP per minute      |
| Others                        | 6,000 requests per IP per minute | 60,000 requests per IP per minute |

All rate limits are calculated per IP address over a one minute window.

Rate limits can be increased for paid plans. Please [contact us](mailto:info+rate-limits@medplum.com?subject=Increase%20rate%20limits) for more information.

## FHIR Interaction Load Rate Limit

In addition to limits on the number of requests that can be made to the Medplum server, there is a limit on the total load of the interactions made to the Medplum server. Different interactions with the datastore are weighted by complexity and impact, and **the sum of a user's interactions in a given minute** must remain under the user's total load limit.

:::warning

FHIR interaction quotas are currently in draft, and are not yet finalized. Specific details about how
the limits are calculated and enforced are subject to change.

The quota is calculated as the sum of each user's interactions in a given minute, where each interaction is weighted by its impact on the data store. Here are the weights used to calculate the quota:

| FHIR Operation | Points Cost | Description |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Read | 1 point | Basic resource read operation |
| Create | 100 points | Creating a new resource |
| Update | 100 points | Full resource update |
| Delete | 100 points | Deleting a resource |
| Patch | 100 points | Partial resource update |
| Search | 20 points | Searching resources |
| History | 10 points | Retrieving resource version history |

:::

FHIR uses [specific terminology](http://hl7.org/fhir/restful-interaction) to categorize different interactions with
the data store, e.g. `search` and `update`. These interactions are weighted by complexity and impact to the data store,
with the sum of each user's interactions in a given minute compared to the configured limit. There is also
a limit on the total interactions for all users within a Project as a whole, which defaults to ten times the per-user
limit.

### How to view your project's FHIR quota rate limits

The FHIR quota rate limit that will be enforced on each User in a Project can be viewed in the [Project's](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/project) system settings:

- `Project.systemSettings.userFhirQuota` - integer value limit FHIR quota for each User in the Project
- `Project.systemSettings.totalFhirQuota` - integer value limit for the sum of all concurrent Users' FHIR quota in the Project

If those values are not set, then the default values from the [Project Settings](/docs/self-hosting/project-settings#project-system-settings) will be used.

### How to set a custom FHIR quota rate limit for a User, Bot, or ClientApplication

There are some scenarios where you may want to **set a custom quota for a User, Bot, or ClientApplication**. For example, say you expect higher traffic for a specific User, Bot, or ClientApplication than the default user quota in your project, you can set a custom quota for that User, Bot, or ClientApplication. See [how to set user-specific FHIR quotas](/docs/access/user-configuration#user-specific-fhir-quota-rate-limits) for more information about how to do this. 

:::info
Note that the `totalFhirQuota` will still be enforced, but `userFhirQuota` will be overridden for the User, Bot, or ClientApplication.

## Reporting Request and Load Rate Limits: HTTP Headers

All API calls affected by rate limits will include a `RateLimit` header with details about the applicable limits:

```
RateLimit: "requests";r=59999;t=60, "fhirInteractions";r=49894;t=60
```

Each logical limit reports the number of units remaining (`r`) and the time remaining, in seconds, until
the limit resets (`t`). Applications should use these reported values to proactively slow down activity when
few units are remaining, in order to prevent service disruption. Once a `429 Too Many Requests` error is produced,
applications should not retry until after at least the indicated number of seconds have passed and the limit has
been reset.
