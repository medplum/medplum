# Intro

If you have never heard of Medplum Bots, we encourage you to read the intro material in the [**Bot Guide**](./bots/bot-basics).

Medplum bots are functions that execute when triggered. They are similar to AWS Lambda functions, and in Medplum we make them easy to write and deploy and trigger with [FHIR Subscriptions](/docs/subscriptions). For the purpose of the tutorials found in this section, it's important to understand that **Bots drive many of the major integrations that you see in Medplum**.

The following tutorials will walk through some of the use cases for Bots, to give you a sense of how they can work for you.

:::warning Enabling Bots

Bots are a [project level setting](/docs/access/projects#settings) that must be enabled by a Super Admin user.

For users on the [Medplum Hosted Service](/pricing), bots are a paid features. Contact info@medplum.com or reach out in our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/medplum) to have Bots enabled on your project.

Super administrators can enable bots via the Medplum App:

- Navigate to https://app.your-medplum-domain.com/Project/:projectId
- Click on the "Edit" tab
- In the "Features" section, add an entry with the value "bots"
