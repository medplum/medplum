There are many ways to **contribute to the Medplum community without coding in 5-10 minutes**.

We welcome all who are interested to participate. This page includes pointers and instructions.

## Join our online community

We have several online venues where Medplum community members and team members convene.

1. Star the [Medplum Github Repo](https://github.com/medplum/medplum)
2. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/medplum) - and introduce yourself
3. Subscribe to [Medplum on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/medplum)

## File Bug Reports

If you see something, say something. Please file an [issue](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/issues) in our GitHub repository. We appreciate specific details.

## Improve our Documentation

Did you learn how to do something using Medplum but it wasn't obvious on first try? Please contribute to our documentation!

Our documentation is hosted on [medplum.com/docs](/docs), but it is built from markdown files that live in our [Github repository](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/tree/main/packages/docs/docs).

If you open the documentation on [Github.dev](https://github.dev/medplum/medplum/blob/main/packages/docs/docs/contributing/index.md) you won't need to clone the repository.
