# Invite a user

This guide explains how to invite another user to your Medplum project.

Open the Medplum app in your browser: https://app.medplum.com/  If you don't have an account yet, see the [Register](./register) page.

Navigate to the Project Admin page.  Click on the top-left icon and choose "Project".

Click on the "Invite" link.

Fill in the user details such as first name, last name, and email address.

For advanced security features, you can configure an [AccessPolicy](/docs/developers/fhir/accesspolicy).  An AccessPolicy allows you to specify which resource types users can read and write.

Click "Invite" when the user details are ready.

When you click "Invite", the system will send an email to the user with instructions how to activate their new account.
