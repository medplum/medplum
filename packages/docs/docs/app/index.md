# Medplum App

The Medplum App is the user-facing web application available at <https://app.medplum.com/>. The app is a quick way to setup projects, manage users, and inspect resources.

While Medplum is most powerful when used as an API, you can accomplish many tasks directly from the app.

## Guides

1. [Register](https://app.medplum.com/register) a new account and project
2. [Invite](./app/invite) another user to your project
3. [Create a patient](./tutorials/create-a-patient)
