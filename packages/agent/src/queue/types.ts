/**
 * Lifecycle state for a row in `inbound_hl7_messages`.
 *
 * `state` tracks the **Bot leg** — the message's journey to the Medplum server
 * and back — and the worker scheduling lifecycle. The independent **source leg**
 * (delivering the app-level ACK back to the sending device) is tracked
 * separately in {@link AckOutcome}, so the two can't be conflated: a message the
 * Bot accepted but whose ACK we couldn't return is `processed` + `undelivered`,
 * NOT a Bot-leg failure. See DURABLE_QUEUE_ARCHITECTURE.md §4 for the transition diagram.
 *
 * - `queued`     — inserted, awaiting worker dispatch; OR a retryable failure
 *                  was scheduled for auto-retry (`next_attempt_at` set, see §4.1).
 * - `claimed`    — a worker has claimed the row off the queue, but the
 *                  `agent:transmit:request` has NOT yet been written to the
 *                  WebSocket (it's still buffered in the in-memory send queue).
 *                  A crash here is UNAMBIGUOUS — the server provably never saw
 *                  it — so recovery returns it to `queued` (no duplicate risk).
 * - `inflight`   — the request has been written to the socket (`sent_at` stamped)
 *                  and the worker is awaiting the server's response. A crash here
 *                  is AMBIGUOUS (the server may have processed it), so recovery
 *                  marks it `failed` for operator review, never silently retries.
 * - `processed`  — the Bot accepted it (server 2xx). Says nothing about whether
 *                  the source ACK was delivered — see {@link AckOutcome}.
 * - `rejected`   — terminal: the Bot rejected the message itself (permanent 4xx).
 *                  Retrying can never help; the content must be triaged.
 * - `failed`     — terminal-for-now: a transient/ambiguous Bot-leg failure
 *                  (5xx, 429, response timeout, dispatch error, or "interrupted" —
 *                  a row found `inflight` on startup). Default (guaranteed) mode
 *                  retries all of these; normal mode retries only the transient
 *                  codes and leaves the ambiguous ones here for review (see §4.1).
 *                  Never confused with a `rejected` message.
 * - `nacked`     — rejected at intake; sender was told NACK and the row exists only for audit.

/**
 * Machine-readable classification attached to every post-commit failure.
 *
 * Codes are assigned at the failure site (the worker knows which path failed)
 * and stored in the `error_code` column alongside the human-readable
 * `last_error`, so operators and tooling can reason about *why* a row errored
 * without parsing free-form error strings.
 *
 * Most codes here describe a **Bot-leg** failure (they annotate a `rejected` or
 * `failed` row). The source-leg ACK-delivery outcome is NOT an error code — it
 * lives on its own axis ({@link AckOutcome}), precisely so a failed ACK can
 * never be misread as a re-dispatchable upstream failure. The trailing
 * **intake-rejection** codes are the exception: they annotate `nacked` audit
 * rows (a message intake refused before it was ever committed), so tooling can
 * tell a storage-error reject from a duplicate-collision reject without parsing
 * `last_error`. A retry policy must never act on a `nacked` row — it was never
 * accepted — so these codes are outside the transient/ambiguous/permanent split.
 *
 * The Bot-leg codes are grouped into three failure classes — the distinction the
 * retry policy keys off of (see {@link RETRYABLE_ERROR_CODES} and the §4 retry rules):
 *
 * - **Transient** — the failure says nothing about the message itself, so a
 *   later attempt could succeed. Safe to auto-retry: re-dispatch cannot
 *   duplicate work, because the server provably never accepted the message.
 *   Row state: `failed`.
 * - **Ambiguous** — the request may have reached the server, so re-dispatching
 *   would risk duplicate processing. The row lands in `failed` for operator
 *   review but is NOT auto-retried in normal mode. (See the §4 note below.)
 * - **Permanent** — retrying can never help; the message itself was rejected.
 *   Row state: `rejected`.
 *
 * Retry-gating rule (§4) — the whole point of the transient/ambiguous split:
 * the `failed` state is NOT uniformly retryable. It covers BOTH transient and
 * ambiguous codes, so a retry policy must gate on the *code*, never the `failed`
 * state alone. In normal (default) mode only the transient codes
 * ({@link RETRYABLE_ERROR_CODES}: `ServerError`, `ServerRateLimited`) auto-retry;
 * the ambiguous codes (`ResponseTimeout`, `Interrupted`, `WorkerStopped`,
 * `DispatchFailed`) stay operator-review-only, because the server may have
 * already processed the message and a blind re-dispatch would double-process.
 * They only become safe to auto-retry once server-side callback-keyed dedupe
 * makes redispatch idempotent. The explicit `guaranteedDelivery` opt-in
 * overrides this and retries the ambiguous codes too (duplication risk
 * accepted), stopping only on a definitive upstream answer — see
 * {@link GUARANTEED_TERMINAL_CODES}.
