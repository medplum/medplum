   * MigrationVersion.FIRST_BOOT
   *
   * When first running server, "DatabaseMigration"."firstBoot" is initialized to true. The value
   * is used in `getPostDeployVersion` to potentially mask the actual post-deploy version to facilitate
   * more graceful handling of interruptions to the process of running post-deploy migrations
   * and the fatal version checks that can potentially halt the server if startup process
   * doesn't make it to the steady-state of having run all pre-deploy and post-deploy migrations.
   *
   * While "firstBoot" is true, there are a couple differences in behavior:
   *
   * 1. The `requiredVersion` checks from the post-deploy manifest file are skipped. This is
   *    because the server (specifically in dev mode) is sensitive to restarts while still in the
   *    process of running post-deploy migrations since since it would be possible to get in
   *    a state where the current server version is greater than the `requiredVersion` of a
   *    post-deploy migration. Normally that causes server to refuse to start up, but not so in
   *    FIRST_BOOT mode.
   *
   * The "firstBoot" column is not updated to `false` until every post-deploy migration
   * completes successfully. Once the value is `false`, it is never set back to `true`.
   * See {@link markPostDeployMigrationCompleted} for more details.
