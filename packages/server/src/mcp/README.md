What is [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.org/)?

> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## Testing with MCP Inspector

Start the inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```
