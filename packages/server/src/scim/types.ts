 * SCIM PATCH request.
 *
 *   HTTP PATCH is an OPTIONAL server function that enables clients to
 *   update one or more attributes of a SCIM resource using a sequence of
 *   operations to "add", "remove", or "replace" values.  Clients may
 *   discover service provider support for PATCH by querying the service
 *   provider configuration (see Section 4).
 *
 *   The general form of the SCIM PATCH request is based on JSON Patch
 *   [RFC6902].  One difference between SCIM PATCH and JSON Patch is that
 *   SCIM servers do not support array indexing and do not support
 *   [RFC6902] operation types relating to array element manipulation,
 *   such as "move".
 *
 *   The body of each request MUST contain the "schemas" attribute with
 *   the URI value of "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp".
 *
 *   The body of an HTTP PATCH request MUST contain the attribute
 *   "Operations", whose value is an array of one or more PATCH
 *   operations.  Each PATCH operation object MUST have exactly one "op"
 *   member, whose value indicates the operation to perform and MAY be one
 *   of "add", "remove", or "replace".  The semantics of each operation
 *   are defined in the following subsections.
 *
 * See SCIM 3.5.2 - Modifying with PATCH
 * https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.5.2
