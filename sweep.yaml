description: 'In the packages directory, a file will usually have tests located in the same folder. Please make sure we update the tests in this case. For example if you modify packages/fhir-router/src/urlrouter.ts, you should check packages/fhir-router/src/urlrouter.tests.ts in case we need to test the new code. We care about test coverage, so if you add a separate execution path, add a new test rather than replacing the logic.'
