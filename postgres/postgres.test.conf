# PostgreSQL configuration optimized for testing
# These settings sacrifice durability for speed - DO NOT use in production

# Key optimizations:
# - fsync disabled: No fsync syscalls after writes
# - synchronous_commit off: Async WAL writes
# - full_page_writes off: Reduces WAL volume
# - wal_level minimal: Minimal WAL logging
