# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.

# Dev is the default owner for everything in the repo.
* @medplum/dev

# FDE is the default owner for the "examples" directory.
/examples/ @medplum/fde

# Both Dev and FDE own the packages/docs directory.
/packages/docs/ @medplum/dev @medplum/fde
