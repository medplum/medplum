This example app demonstrates the following:

- Creating a new React app with Vite and TypeScript to demonstrate [`Coverage`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverage)-based workflows.
- Managing the insurance eligibility check workflow.
  - Initiating checks with the [`CoverageEligibilityRequest`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverageeligibilityrequest) resource.
  - Managing the status of [`CoverageEligibilityRequests`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverageeligibilityrequest)
  - Receiving and reviewing responses with the [`CoverageEligibilityResponse`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverageeligibilityresponse) resource.
- Creating [`Coverage`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverage) and [`CoverageEligibilityRequest`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverageeligibilityrequest) resources.
- Editing a [`Coverage`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverage) resource.
- Deleting a [`Coverage`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverage) resource.

In addition, the demo provides an example [`Bot`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/bot) that mimics the workflow of an insurance eligibility check. It takes a [`CoverageEligibilityRequest`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverageeligibilityrequest) and returns a dummy [`CoverageEligibilityResponse`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverageeligibilityresponse).

### Code Organization

This repo is organized into two main directories: `src` and `data`.

The `src` directory contains the app, including `pages` and `components` directories. In addition, it contains a `bots` directory, which has [Medplum Bots](/packages/docs/docs/bots/bot-basics.md) for use. The bots in this directory are intended as an example, and will need to be modified by users for real-world use.

The `data` directory contains data that can be uploaded to use in the demo. The `example` directory contains data that is meant to be used for learning and testing, while the `core` directory contains resources, terminologies, and more that are required to use the demo.
