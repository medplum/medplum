/**
 * This bot is designed to be executed whenever a `CoverageEligibilityRequest` is created. It will take the request and initiate an
 * insurance eligibility check process, ultimately creating a `CoverageEligibilityResponse` resource with the results. For more
 * details on insurance eligibility checks see https://www.medplum.com/docs/billing/insurance-eligibility-checks
 *
 * NOTE: This Bot only illustrates the relevant workflow. To implement the process, you will need to choose a coverage clearinghouse
 * to work with and modify the code to query that clearinghouse.
 *
 * @param medplum - MedplumClient
 * @param event - BotEvent<CoverageEligibilityRequest>
 * @returns the CoverageEligibilityResponse
