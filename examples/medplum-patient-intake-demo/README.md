This example app demonstrates the following:

- How to build a patient intake form on Medplum collecting demographics, coverage, Social Determinants of Health, languages and consent information.
- Converting the form data into structured data ([`Patient`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient), [`Coverage`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/coverage), [`Observation`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation)) for easy retrieval and longitudinal tracking.
- Implementing conditional flows in questionnaires.
- Using [Medplum React Components](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-introduction--docs) to build a patient intake form.

### Code Organization

This repo is organized into two main directories: `src` and `data`.

The `src` directory contains the React app that implements the intake form UX. In addition, it contains a `bots` directory, which has [Medplum Bots](/packages/docs/docs/bots/bot-basics.md) to implement the parsing of the questionnaire response into structured data.

The `data` directory contains data that can be uploaded for use in the demo. The `example` directory contains data that is meant to be used for testing and learning, while the `core` directory contains resources, terminologies, and more that are necessary to use the demo.

### UI and components

- Patients page listing all the patients in the system
- Patients chart page page with 3 panels:
  - Clinical Chart
  - Details (including SDOH and Consents)
  - Actions (with a button to fill in the intake form)
- Patient intake form page to fill in the intake questionnaire
- Intake form customization page where it's possible to edit fields of the intake form.

npm run build:bots
```

Then, run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

This app should run on `http://localhost:3000/`
