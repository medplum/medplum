This example app demonstrates the following:

- Creating a new React app with Vite and TypeScript to demonstrate [`Task`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/task)-based workflows
- Managing the [`Task`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/task) lifecycle: Creating, assigning, and completing tasks
- Creating a [`Task`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/task)
- Editing a [`Task`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/task)
- Deleting a [`Task`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/task)
- Viewing [`Task`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/task) queues that are relevant to the user

### Code Organization

This repo is organized in two main directories: `src` and `data`.

The `src` directory contains the entire app, including `pages` and `components` directories. In addition, it contains a `bots` directory which has [Medplum Bots](/packages/docs/docs/bots/index.md) for use. The bots in the `example` directory are intended to be modified or extended by users, while those in `core` can be used to handle core workflows without modification.

The `data` directory contains data that can be uploaded to use the demo. In the `example` directory is data that is meant to be used for learning and testing, not production. The `core` directory contains resource, terminologies, and more that are required to use this demo.
