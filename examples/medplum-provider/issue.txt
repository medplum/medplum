Inside of the examples/medplum-provider app, add a new Route called /Tasks/

This new page should show the standard app UI wrapper. The internals of the page should then be two columns:

Column 1: Task Filters:
- ~25% of the screen width, minimum width 200px. Filter can be hidden or opened up, but, by default, is visible. When hidden, a tab
on the left hand side of the screen can be clicked to open it.
- shows a list of possible filters on top of the tasks stored in the system. This includes allowing selecting a specific user's assigned tasks,
or a specific CareTeam, Organization, or Group. Each of these should allow a multi-select in the UI and show a dropdown w/ typeahead
to select the filters. Filters should show up in the URL, so that copy/pasting the URL allows people to share the currently selected filters.
- Filter for open/closed tasks, by default should show only open tasks.
- Filter for other task fields. Please research and suggest other options here.

Column 2: Active Tasks:
- Remainder of the screen real-estate.
- Shows all of the tasks for the current filter, sorted with Urgent or STAT tasks up top, otherwise sorted by due date (with the soonest dates near the top)
and then by created date ascendting.

Implementation should follow existing patterns for visuals and components as well as code styles.

Note that all of the data modeling is in the FHIR standard format. For reference, the FHIR Tasks object is specified here: https://build.fhir.org/task.html.
