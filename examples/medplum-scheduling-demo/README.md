This example app demonstrates the following:

- How to build a scheduling app on Medplum for providers that manages the lifecycle of appointments, integrates with patient and practitioner data.
- Creating [`Slots`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/slot) to manage the provider availability.
- Managing the [`Appointment`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/appointment) lifecycle: Creating, rescheduling, and canceling appointments.
- Creating an [`Encounter`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/encounter) after an appointment is completed.
- Using [Medplum React Components](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-introduction--docs) to build a scheduling app.

### Code Organization

This repo is organized into two main directories: `src` and `data`.

The `src` directory contains the entire app, including `pages` and `components` directories. In addition, it contains a `bots` directory which has [Medplum Bots](/packages/docs/docs/bots/index.md) for use. The bots in the `example` directory are intended to be modified or extended by users, while those in `core` can be used to handle core workflows without modification.

The `data` directory contains data that can be uploaded for use in the demo. The `example` directory contains data that is meant to be used for testing and learning, while the `core` directory contains resources, terminologies, and more that are necessary to use the demo.

### UI and components

- Patients page listing all the patients in the system.
- Patients chart page with 3 panels:
  - Clinical Chart
  - Details (including Appointments and Encounters)
  - Actions (with a button to create a new appointment)
- Schedule page to manage the provider availability and create new appointments.
- Appointment page listing all appointments for the provider.
- Appointment details page to view and manage the appointment lifecycle.
