This example app demonstrates the following:

- Using [Medplum React Components](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-introduction--docs) to display a chart that provides visibility on a patient
  - More information on a [charting experience](https://www.medplum.com/docs/charting)
- Using [Medplum GraphQL](https://graphiql.medplum.com/) queries to fetch linked resources

### Components of the Patient Chart

The Patient Chart has 3 distinct panels

1. Clinical Chart
  The left panel shows the patient history and their status. Notable information in the clinical chart includes the following Resources:
    - Patient Information
    - Upcoming Appointments
    - Documented Visits 
    - List of Allergies
    - List of Problems
    - Medication Requests
    - Smoking Status
    - Vitals 

2. Tasks
  The center panel shows list of the Task resource with a different focus resource. 
    - Each focus is interactive to either review or fill out
    - This example project demonstrates interactions of the following resources:
      - Questionnaire
      - QuestionnaireResponse
      - DiagnosticReport 
      - CarePlan

3. SOAP Note
  The right most panel documents an enounter with the patient through a questionnaire. Filling out and submitting the questionnaire automatically creates a task, with the response as the focus to be reviewed.
